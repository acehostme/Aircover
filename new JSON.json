Check to make sure all parts on the \npacking list are in the kit. If there are any missing \nparts, notify Titan Aircraft as soon as possible. Parts \nthat are missing and noted as \"Back Ordered\" or \n\"Items BO\" on the packing list will be shipped as \nsoon as they become available. Any parts missing \nfrom your kit that are not marked as back ordered \nwill need to be brought to Titan Aircraft’s attention \nwithin the first 7 days of receiving your kit. After the \nfirst 7 days you will be charged for any item not on \nthe back order list. \n \nA Titan part number prefix specifies the aircraft \nmodel and the major assembly or purpose. The part \nnumber will begin with T or M. T is for Tornado and \nM is for Mustang. There are parts that are common \nto both the Tornado and Mustang, so some part \nnumbers will begin with the letter T. The second \nletter designates a major assembly or purpose. \nSecond letters are: F- fuselage, W- wing, G- gear, T- \ntail, C- control, P- power plant, E- electrical or \ninstrumentation, H- hardware and J- jigs or tools. \nFor example, the MW in the part number MW02-4 \nwould mean Mustang Wing; a TW prefix would \nmean Tornado Wing; an MG prefix would mean \nMustang Gear; an MC prefix would mean Mustang \ncontrol; etc. \n \nThe leading edge D-cells are shipped in foam \nsaddles. The saddles should be used as wing stands \nduring assembly and can be used later to store the \nwings if they are removed from the aircraft. When in \nuse, be sure the root end of the wing is placed in the \nsaddle so the aluminum leading edge does not \ncontact the floor. \n \nThroughout \nthe \nassembly \ninstructions \nprint \nreferences will not include the revision suffix. For \nexample, print number T51-02-INS-0385-A will be \nnoted as T51-02-INS-0385. \n \nLayouts, centerlines, and other marks should be \nmade with a fine tip marker such as a Sharpie. \nPencils should not be used on aluminum. \n \nParts will need to be drilled and temporarily attached \nwith clecos. After fitting an assembly, the clecos will \nbe removed, chips cleaned out and parts deburred \nbefore riveting or bolting anything permanently. \n \nCAUTION: Acetone, MEK, lacquer thinner, gasoline, \npaint thinner and many other solvents can destroy the \nEPS foam inside the leading edge D-cell. When \ncleaning in the area of the D-cell it is important to use a \ncloth or paper towel that is only damp with the solvent. \nDripping any solvent into the D-cell through drill holes, \naround rivets heads or through any opening will destroy \nthe EPS foam and severely weaken the wing structure.  \n \nSurfaces will need to be prepared prior to bonding \nthroughout the kit. Wipe the area clean with acetone or \nMEK paying attention to the caution above. If the area is \nnot pre-sanded, sand the area to be bonded with #80 \nsandpaper and clean again with acetone or MEK. \n \nUralane adhesive will be used in many places. Uralane \nshould last about 6 months if stored properly. Storing \nUralane in sealed containers in the freezer will increase \nits shelf life. Moisture contamination and even high \nhumidity can shorten its shelf life to a week or two. Part \nA (the clear part) will become cloudy and start to form a \nskin on its surface as it goes bad. \n \nWhen applying the Uralane glue it is recommended to \nuse a tongue depressor with one end cut-off. The \ndepressor allows you to spread a thin layer of Uralane on \nthe bonding surfaces. (Be sure to use the correct amount \nof hardener when mixing. Too much hardener does not \nallow the glue to settle.) Uralane is measured by weight \nfor mixing. The proper ratio is: part A (the clear part) 10 \nparts by weight to part B (the greenish brown part) 4 \nparts by weight. Warm the work area to at least 70° F \n(21° C). Uralane should not be used if the room \ntemperature is below 70° F (21° C). Cure time is about \n24 hours. Full strength will be reached in 7 days. The \nskins are attached with flush rivets and Uralane \nadhesive. SK series 1/8\" flush Pop rivets are supplied in \nthe kit for this purpose. Solid MS-20426 rivets may be \nused however, the builder will have to supply these extra \nrivets and the build time is likely to increase. (NOTE: \nThe T-51 kit includes MS-20424 solid rivets but they are \nfor use in other areas.) SD series dome head Pop rivets \nare supplied in the kit and are to be used any place that \ndoes not require flush rivets. Rivet callouts will be found \non the prints. A #30 hole (#30 drill = .1285 dia.) will \nwork well for the 1/8\" Pop rivets supplied in the kit. The \n1/8\" flush Pop rivets will require either dimpled or \ncountersunk holes. Material .032\" or thicker should be \ncountersunk with a 120° countersink tool (solid MS \n20426 rivets require a 100° countersink tool). Material \n.025 and thinner will need to be dimpled with 1/8\" \ndimple dies. \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0001-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 2 of 2 \n \n____________________________  \n \n____________________ \nBy \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDate \n \n____________________________  \n \n____________________ \nChecked \n \n \n \n \n \nDate \n \n____________________________  \n \n____________________ \nApproved \n \n \n \n \n \nDate",

    "content": "Document No: T51-08-DOC-0014-B \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 1 of 1 \n \n \nTITAN AIRCRAFT T-51 MUSTANG \nCONSTRUCTION BRIEF \n \nFirst time builders and those unfamiliar with sheet metal construction and polyfiber covering are \nrecommended to read ‘Jeppesen’s Aircraft Sheet Metal’, source information from the Internet and \nothers familiar with these materials and methods.   \n \nThe following is a brief outline suggesting how the Titan T-51 building process may be planned based \non sourced information and our experience: \n \n1. First, check the inventory sheet/packing slip to be sure everything is included. There is the \npossibility that some parts may be back ordered.  Now is the appropriate time to put the \nUralane/Araldite two-part glue into cold storage (as recommended in the manual) until it is \nneeded (put back into cold storage after each use).  It is also recommended to store the glue \nin the supplied bottles to reduce air exposure. \n \n2. Any ferrous parts that are not protected may need CRC or similar to prevent rust until painting \n– this includes the main landing gear. \n \n3. Decide where to start – there are two options:  fuselage or center section.  Regardless of what \nis started first, the two fuselage steel frames and main landing gear legs (which will need to \nbe removed from the center section) will need to be prepared (degrease and scotch brite), \nprimed and painted.  \n  \nSTARTING WITH THE CENTER SECTION \n \n1. The center section assembly should be completed up to the installation of the top skins and \ncovering the fuel tanks.  These items should be left until the center section is attached to the \nfuselage and the fuel tanks are plumbed.  It is recommended to build the outer wing panels off \nof the center section, which can be done before the center section is attached to the fuselage. \nThe ailerons and flaps can also be temporarily installed and fitted at this time.  Using this \nmethod, the center section acts like a fixture for the wings and the wings become the fixture \nfor the flaps and ailerons. Bear in mind that the outboard wing ribs need to be kept aligned \nwith the root end rib to eliminate the possibility of unwanted washout (keep checking during \nconstruction).  All of this can be done in the vertical position (nose down) with the center \nsection sitting in the foam shipping saddles that it arrived in.  The main gear can be removed \nfor this process making it easier to move the center section around if necessary.  Once the \nwings are built with the ailerons and flaps temporarily fitted, the bottom wing skins can be \nriveted in place. The wings can then be removed and stored until the fuselage and center \nsection are put together.  Before the wings are fitted to the center section it may be necessary \nto remove any excess glue from around the polystyrene leading edge cell in the wing.  This \nwill allow the ‘right angle flange’ attached to the outboard center section rib to fit underneath \nthe leading edge wing skin for riveting. \n \n2. The main landing gear doors can be constructed during the center section assembly while the \nmain gear legs are in place, but before the outer wing panels are installed. Also, this is a \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0014-B \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 2 of 2 \n \nconvenient time to install the landing gear up and down micro-switches. This can be seen in \nthe Center Section folder on the photos disc. \n \nSTARTING WITH THE FUSELAGE \n \n1. A common method for set-up is to rest the fuselage steel frame on several saw horses along \nthe lower frame cross members and longerons. This method is good for doing the internal \nparts fit out and will allow the builder to have the aircraft at a comfortable working height. \nThere are several other options to choose from, including constructing a spine jig, which runs \nthe length of the fuselage and supports the steel frame at the upper cross members, keeping \nthe aircraft suspended – this is very useful for doing belly work. Other builders have gone to \nthe effort of making entire jigs to hold the fuselage in a solid state. All of these methods are \nuseful in their own way, and it is up to the builder which is best for them – clearly the simplest \nand quickest way is to use saw horses. However, there is one point which we have found to \nbe critical to the skinning and tail section assembly process:  do not drill the outer main side \nskins ‘D’ and ‘E’ onto the fuselage unless the fuselage frame is attached to the centre \nsection. Similarly, do not fit the vertical and horizontal stabs (including the hori-stab \ncarrythru’s) unless the fuselage is attached to the centre section. Temporarily attach the \nfuselage to the center section for these processes, and ensure the steel fuselage frame \nstructure is level and straight with regards to the center section, all the way to the tail section. \nOnce the skins are drilled to the desired hole size (most likely 1/8”) and the tail surfaces have \nbeen fitted, the fuselage can be removed from the center section to carry on with the rest of \nthe fuselage and empennage skinning and fit out. All hat sections and stringers will need to be \nfitted and/or installed prior to fitting skins. \n \n2. After the steel fuselage frames have been degreased and painted with a ferrous metal primer, \nor cad plated, or powder coated, then proceed to fitting and bonding the hat sections to the \nfuselage frame – the photos will show you where hat section is not required. At station #2 \nwhere the steel fuselage frame longerons are circular, allow for the curved fuselage cross \nsection shape by bonding the hat sections on the same angle as determined by the upper and \nlower bulkheads. Joggle the overlaps where the hat sections meet with a joggling tool – this is \ndetailed in the construction manual. Prior to fitting the hat sections, fit and Cleco all upper and \nlower bulkheads. Also, if the hori-stab carry thrus have not yet been installed, then temporarily \nclamp them in position – this will ensure that hat sections are not installed in the wrong \nplaces. There is no need to drill any holes in the hat sections prior to the skinning \nprocess – due to the slight variations in the steel fuselage frame it is better to lay down \nthe rivet lines onto the main side skins first (#40 hole size), and then match drill these \nholes onto the hat sections. However, care must be taken to ensure the rivet layout does \nnot interfere with the steel fuselage frame. Once all the fuselage hat sections are bonded onto \nthe steel frame, paint the entire structure with a good primer. It is recommended to paint all \naluminium to prevent corrosion. Steel parts must be painted. It is also recommended to use \nan anti-corrosive product such as AV8 Dinitrol (comes in aerosol) on all unseen internal areas \n(on top of paint) to add to corrosion prevention. \n \n3. \nOnce the fuselage is attached to the center section for the last time, the skins can be riveted as access to \nareas becomes unnecessary. However it is much easier to complete the construction process without \nriveting skins on until the final stages when all internals are completed, otherwise it makes for a very \ndifficult and time consuming task if skins are preventing good access to your area of work. All cockpit \nfloor panels will need to be installed before the fuselage is married to the centre section for the final \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0014-B \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 3 of 3 \n \ntime. Temporarily remove the two steel windscreen frame support tubes to allow better access during \nthe cockpit construction stage – they will need to be installed and removed several times throughout the \ninstrument hood and windscreen construction stage however. Ensure the cockpit floor panels are in \nplace prior to fitting the u-channels for the cockpit inner side panels. Also, it is easier to drill the \ncockpit inner side panels at the same time as drilling the outer main side skins by using the same holes \nand drilling all the way thru from the outside into the cockpit u channels and inner cockpit side panels \nall at once. Bulkheads #2 (firewall) and #3 will need to be installed at this stage. Installation and fit-out \nof the rudder pedals, control sticks, bell cranks, cable lines, tail wheel, hydraulic lines, braked lines, \ncockpit layout, instrument panel, radiator pipes, tail section (control surfaces), baggage compartments, \nradiator ducting, windshield, rear cockpit partitions, hat rack, and mounts for battery; hydraulic pump; \nE.L.T, etc, will be easier to do prior the marrying the fuselage and centre section for the final time. \nCertain partitions and plumbing will have to be carried out after the fuse and center section meet \nhowever. \n \n4. \n Once the fuselage is mated to the center section for the final time, the outer wings can be installed for \nthe final time also. The top skin should remain off until all ailerons and flaps have been installed and \nset up however. The aileron will need to be temporarily removed to install the aileron and flap defector \npieces, however it will be necessary to have it in place during the fitting of this piece to ensure proper \nfitment. The flap can remain attached to its hinges throughout the fitment of the deflectors and swing \nupside down so as to stay clear during those times in the fitment and installation process when they \nwould otherwise be in the way. \n \n \n5. \nComments on skinning:  Most builders have elected to employ lap joints instead of butt joints – this \nsaves on time and materials, as well as generally looking better and resulting in a smoother finish. Start \nby fitting main side skins ‘D’ and ‘E’ – layout the rivet pattern on the skin first and then match drill \nthru hat sects. Use the factory cut edge as the top edge of the skin, and place this flush with the upper \nlongeron hat sects. Drill out to #40 hole size, then proceed to 1/8” if dimpling, or #30 hole size if using \ndome head rivets. However, it may be useful to leave the hole size at #40 until other internal parts that \npick up on outer skin rivet holes have been fitted, and then drill thru all the parts together for the final \nhole size  - this ensures the hole does not become enlarged from constant redrilling and clecoing thru \nthe same hole. Fit the turtle deck and belly skins if they haven’t already. Ensure the edges (esp. top \nedge) of the side skins that overlap the upper skins are joggled (slightly rolled over using a skin edge \njoggling tool) to ensure a neat finish without gaps along the edges – this is important for corrosion \nprevention also. To maintain a clean looking fuselage skin line, the upper skins are overlapped with the \nside skins along the entire length of the fuselage. This is one way of arranging the skins. Where you \nhave a lap joint, drill the overlapping skin first, and then place the underlying skin in place and match \ndrill thru it. Some builders have also joggled the edges of the underlying skin with a sheet metal bench \nmounted joggling tool to achieve a ‘flat’ surface finish – once again, it is up to the builder to what level \nof finish they want. The simplest method is to use lap joints and dome head rivets. The forward upper \nbulkhead flanges (the surface the skins attach to) may need to be slightly shaped outward to allow for \nthe angled skin line in that area. Most builders rivet up the tail section skins (once the tail section is \ncomplete) and turtle deck first, as these skins are not restrictive of access to the rest of the fuselage. \nThen once the belly radiator ducting is complete, the belly and belly side skins are installed. Leaving \nthe main side skins off until the internal fit out and systems checks are complete is highly \nrecommended. \n \n6. \nThe installation of temporary stringers (lengths of right angle aluminum) between bulkheads is also \nhelpful to add rigidity to the structure, and keeps bulkheads straight and perpendicular during the \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0014-B \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 4 of 4 \n \nskinning process. Also, because of the hole enlargement that happens as a result of the dimpling \nprocess, it is advised to keep the hole size as small as possible for the dimple die so as to avoid \noversized holes which may result in rivet failure – as stated previously, do not drill out rivet holes to \ntheir final size until all the layers that use the same hole are fitted. \n \n \n7. \nThe vertical stab will need to be installed (mentioned earlier) prior to fitting the tail section skins. \n \n8. \nThe horizontal stabs should be built attached to the fuselage whilst the fuse is attached to the centre \nsection, after the horizontal stab carry thrus have been installed. Fit the leading edges into the stab carry \nthrus, and then proceed to fit the ribs, aft spar, and then skins. Ensure the structure is built level and \nsquare with reference to the fuselage, which should be level and square with reference to the centre \nsect. Once the stabs have been constructed the elevators can be fitted in place also. The elevators and \nrudder will need either covering with fabric or aluminum, depending on the chosen engine type (Rotax \nengine = fabric, Suzuki engine = metal). The elevator trim tab wiring will need installing prior to this. \nLeave the outer rib on both stabs clecoed during the final installation of the stabs to allow easier \ninstallation of the elevators. The tail side skins will need to be riveted prior to the final installation of \nthe stabs and elevators. \n \n \n9. \nThe forward baggage compartment is useful for those using the Rotax engine (due to tail heaviness a \nrear baggage locker is not advised). Vice versa for the Suzuki engine models – a rear baggage locker is \nadvised instead of the forward locker. However, access to station #2 is required to provide access to the \nengine management computer and brake fluid reservoir for those using the Suzuki engine.  \n \n10. It is recommended to partition off the rear cockpit from the rest of fuselage (which is necessary for \nthose having a rear baggage locker anyway), and from the flap driver and radiator intake area. This can \nbe seen on the photos disc. Having an access panel on the bottom or side belly skins can facilitate \naccess to the radiator. \n \n \n11. Radiators, regardless of engine type, need to be placed in the belly scoop area to facilitate sufficient \nairflow. Several builders of Rotax powered T-51s have had overheating issues when the radiator \nis placed in the engine cowling area, and is not advised. \n \n12. The concern of possible carb icing on the Rotax engines can be eliminated by the installation of the \n‘Skydrive carb heat kit’, or a fuel injection mod. \n \n \n13. The two steel brackets wielded to the aft fuse steel frame in the T/W area (with hole cut-outs) are for \ninserting a tube – this is extremely useful for supporting the fuselage in a suspended fashion for landing \ngear testing, lifting, etc (see photos). Respective holes will need to be cut out of the side skins to \naccommodate this function. With regards to ground crew handling - it is easiest to handle the aircraft \nwith two people, one on each wingtip. Failing that, the prop, gear legs, and aforementioned tube are all \nusable for this purpose. There is also a steel plate wielded to the fuselage frame on the upper longeron \nin the rear seat area – this is an optional handle to assist climbing onto the centre section wing walkway \narea, and requires cutting away of the outer cockpit skin and installing a hinged aluminum flap. \nHowever, it has been found that mounting the centre section is easiest by ‘climbing’ up from the front \nwheel. \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0014-B \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 5 of 5 \n \n14.  At the bottom rear of station #14 is a threaded hole for a tie down hoop. A hole will need to be cut in \nthe bottom tail skin to accommodate this. This can also serve as a ‘skid’ in the advent of T/W failure, \nand/or tail first landing. \n \n15. The instrument panel can accommodate a removable ‘six pack’ of flight instruments. There are many \nalternatives in this area, some builders opting for the fully glass panels, whilst others choosing a basic \nminimum to meet their requirements. There are two bolts wielded to the fuselage frame at station #4 in \nfront of the instrument panel – these bolts can be used as a common electrical ground. \n \n16. The use of lightening holes throughout bulkheads is useful for keeping weight down, and for providing \nextra strength if the hole edges are joggled/pressed. Consult Titan for allowable placement areas. \n \n17. Ensure to fit forward fuselage skins prior to engine installation, so as to ensure fuselage frame is not \naltered by the engine weight. If engine is mounted prior to riveting (which it probably will be), check \nframe is not altered prior to riveting. Support the weight of the engine to be sure, especially the heavier \ntypes. \n \n18. The oil cooler works well when placed in the nose bowl chin scoop directly beneath the prop spinner. \nEngine cowling holes that replicate the original P-51D provide good engine airflow thru also. \n \n19. It is advisable to accommodate some form of clean outside air intake for the pilot and passenger. A duct \nin the forward fuselage area (beneath exhaust line and other engine fluid “blow out” area) and belly \narea has proven to be useful. Some builders have taken air from the nose bowl chin scoop also, \nhowever this requires large holes for ducting to be cut into the firewall. It is recommended to put CO \ndetectors on the left and right hand side where the canopy shuts. Insulating the radiator water pipes that \ntraverse thru the cockpit is also advised. \n \n \n20. For those registering their T-51 as a N.Z Microlight (under 1200 Lbs category), the following is \nadvised:  \n \n• Rotax 912 \n• The use of low profile nuts (as opposed to the factory supplied regular size nuts, but only where tensile \nstrength is not required) \n• Lightening holes in bulkheads, rudder pedals, and other allowable areas \n• Minimal instrumentation \n• No G.P.S \n• No ‘add-ons’, e.g. – mock guns, strobe/nav lights \n• Minimal paint application \n• Polished aluminum finish \n• Ali rivets in non critical areas \n• No rear baggage compartment \n• Also, to keep C of G forward it is recommended to place as much weight as possible forward of the \ncockpit, e.g. – battery, hydraulic pump, etc. \n \nAs a final note, it is useful to think several steps ahead when building.  The construction manual \ndrawings generally focus on one point or detail at a time and it is easy to overlook related details in \nthe area being worked on.  Review all drawings and notes for a particular area or system before \nbeginning assembly.  Use common rivet holes for various parts where possible (e.g. inner cockpit \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0014-B \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 6 of 6 \n \nskins and stiffeners).  Most of the time the parts will be independent of each other but will fit a lot \nsimpler, neater and will save extra materials if they can become interdependent.  When considering \nthis approach, temporarily place all of the parts that belong in the current area of work in their \nrespective positions before installation.   \n \nTitan Aircraft must be consulted before any significant modifications, changes, or additions are made \nto the kit (by the builder/owner). \n \nThe explanations above are only a brief outline of T-51 construction tips that have culminated from \nthe combined experience of both Titan Aircraft and Campbell Aviation. The standard rivet in the kit is \nthe (Dome) head pop-rivet, although there are some rivets that will require dimpling or countersinking. \nIf flush rivets are used, it may change the order of operations. Titan Aircraft makes dimple tooling \nspecifically for the type of rivets used for flush riveting, and is available upon request. \n \nA photo CD is provided with the manual and contains photos of the T-51 in various stages of \nconstruction. Photos are taken from many different builders from around the world and can be used \nas a guide for builders and to answer questions that the manual may not clearly explain. If something \nis unclear please do not hesitate to contact Titan Aircraft or your local dealer. There is also a “Titan \nMustang Yahoo Group” link on TitanAircraft.com.

The instant failure is rare and usually occurs only if ignition or fuel flow \ncompletely fails. Most engine failures are gradual and afford the alert pilot ample \nindication that he may expect a failure. An extremely rough-running engine, loss of oil \npressure, excessive coolant temperature under normal flight conditions, loss of manifold \npressure, and fluctuating rpm are indications that a failure may occur. When indications \npoint to an engine failure, the pilot should land immediately. \n \nEngine Air Restart \n \nIf the engine fails in flight and you have sufficient altitude, you may attempt a restart, \nprovided the engine did not fail for obvious mechanical reasons. \n \n1. Airspeed 80 mph. \n2. Ignition switch BOTH. \n3. Master switch ON. \n4. Fuel selector ON. \n5. Fuel boost pump ON. \n6. Ignition switch START if propeller is stopped. \n \nEngine Failure During Take-off Run \n \nThe chances of engine failure during take-off can be greatly reduced if the engine is run \nup carefully and checked thoroughly beforehand. If engine failure occurs during take-off \nrun before the airplane leaves the ground, proceed as follows: \n \n7. Close the throttle completely. \n8. Apply brakes as necessary to effect a quick stop. \n9. If doubt exists as to whether airplane can be brought to a safe stop on runway, \nignition switch OFF and fuel shutoff lever OFF. \n10. Roll canopy back. \n11. Shoulder harness tight. \n12. After stopping, get out of airplane as soon as possible, and remain outside. \n \n \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0015-A \nDate:  12/1/2009 \nPage:  11 of 20 \nEngine Failure During Take-off (Airplane airborne). \n \nMove mixture control to RICH if engine begins to fail. If engine fails completely \nimmediately after take-off (Figure 2), act as follows: \n \n1. Lower nose at once, so that airspeed does not drop below stalling speed. \n2. Roll canopy back. \n3. If time permits, place the wing flaps full DOWN. \n4. Turn ignition switch OFF. \n5. Move fuel shutoff lever to OFF. \n6. Turn master switch OFF. \n7. Shoulder harness tight. \n8. Land straight ahead, changing direction only enough to miss obstructions. \n9. After landing, get out of airplane as quickly as possible and remain outside. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2 \n \n \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0015-A \nDate:  12/1/2009 \nPage:  12 of 20 \nEngine Failure During Flight \n \nIf the engine begins to fail during flight, immediately move the mixture control to RICH. \nIf the engine fails during flight, the airplane may be abandoned, ditched, or brought in for \na dead stick landing. To land with the engine dead, follow these instructions: \n \n1. Lower nose at once so that airspeed does not drop below stalling speed. Keep IAS \nwell above stalling speed. \n2. Turn OFF fuel shutoff lever. \n3. Turn OFF master switch, except when electrical power is desired for lights or \navionics. \n4. Choose an area for landing. If near a landing field, make a radio call. Judge your \nturns carefully and plan to land into the wind. \n5. Roll canopy back. \n6. If a runway is available or if a moderately rough surface is available, landing gear \nhandle DOWN. If landing in rough terrain, keep the gear up. \n7. Wing flaps up, save flaps to overcome possible mistakes in judgment. Lower flaps \nfully when proper landing is ensured. \n8. Land into wind, changing direction only as necessary to miss obstructions. \n9. After landing, get out as quickly as possible and remain outside. \n \nMaximum Glide \n \nMaximum glide distance in event of a dead engine may be attained by gliding at an \nairspeed of 80 mph with gear and flaps up. If conditions permit, propeller control should \nbe placed in full DECREASE in order to reduce drag as much as possible and to \nminimize windmilling. (See Figure 3) \n \nAs this is an experimental airplane and all airplanes are different, the Best Glide speed \nwill vary.

If the fire still persists, turn the master switch OFF. \n \nLand as soon as possible. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0015-A \nDate:  12/1/2009 \nPage:  17 of 20 \nLanding Gear Hydraulic Systems \n \nNote A - Some of the early T-51, below serial number 50, may use the more complicated \nsystem.  Refer to Figure 4. \n \nNote B - You can identify which system is used in the aircraft by the manual valves \ninstalled.  If it has both a dump valve and a bypass valve, it is the early system.  If it only \nhas the dump valve, it is the simpler system.  Refer to Figure 5. \n \nThe early T-51 uses a hydraulic up-lock to lock the gear in the up position. Refer to \nFigure 4. This is accomplished by using an electrically operated valve in the circuit. It is \ndesigned so that whenever power is applied to the hydraulic pump motor it is also applied \nto the valve.  (When power is applied to the valve, the valve is held open allowing fluid \nto flow.) When power is removed from the pump motor, and thus the valve, the valve \ncloses. If for any reason the valve fails to open, either electrical or mechanical, the gear \nwill be locked in whatever position it is in. The system is therefore designed with a \nmanually operated valve that can bypass the electrically operated valve in the event that \nthe electrically operated valve fails. This valve is the yellow manual valve located on the \ncenter pedestal and is labeled, “UP LOCK BYPASS”. If there is ever any concern that \nthe electrically operated valve has failed, the manual bypass valve should be opened. The \nonly negative result of this will be the gear will not be locked in the up position.  \nOtherwise the system will operate perfectly.  In fact the gear will actually up and down \nslightly faster. This is because you are removing the restriction of the electrically \noperated valve. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0015-A \nDate:  12/1/2009 \nPage:  18 of 20 \nEarly Hydraulic Systems \n \n \n \nFigure 4 \n \nAnother safety feature built into the landing gear system is an overpressure switch. This \nswitch is set to open the hydraulic pump circuit if the hydraulic pressure exceeds 400 psi. \nThe normal operating pressure is between 200 psi and 300 psi. If the pressure exceeds \n400 psi, the overpressure switch is activated interrupting power thus shutting off the \nhydraulic pump. When the pump is shut off, the pressure will fall causing the  over \npressure switch to close which will turn the pump back on which will in turn increase the \npressure causing the switch to open turning the hydraulic pump off. The pressure will \ncontinue to oscillate around 400 psi until the problem is corrected. If this oscillation is \nallowed to continue for a prolonged period of time it will result in damage to the \noverpressure switch or possibly the hydraulic pump motor. There are three indicators to \nbring the pilot’s attention to this condition. \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0015-A \nDate:  12/1/2009 \nPage:  19 of 20 \n1. The hydraulic pressure gauge will be oscillating around 400 psi. \n \n2. The amber gear unsafe light will be blinking rapidly. \n \n3. The red overpressure light located on the center pedestal will be blinking \nrapidly. If this condition exists, it is recommended to put the landing gear in \nthe down position and land as soon as practical. \n \nNote:  \n \nIt is very important to stop the oscillation as soon as possible as it could burn \nout the overpressure switch. If the overpressure switch fails in the open \nposition, it will leave the hydraulic pump inoperative.  If this condition \nexists, the red light adjacent to the overpressure bypass circuit breaker will \nbe on steady.  In the event this happens (that is the overpressure fails open): \n \nA safety circuit is provided to bypass the overpressure switch. It is a 20 amp circuit \nbreaker in parallel with the overpressure switch. In the event that the overpressure switch \nfails open, it will interrupt all power to the hydraulic pump motor. This will be indicated \nby the red overpressure light being on steady. In an emergency, the overpressure circuit \nbreaker can be turned on to bypass the defective overpressure switch. This 20 amp circuit \nbreaker will activate if the hydraulic pressure exceeds 600 psi. If this occurs, you may try \na few reset cycles. If this fails, it is recommended to open the emergency dump valve, \nwhich will allow the gear to extend under gravity. This may require side slipping the \naircraft in an effort to put air loads on the gear doors to help pull the gear over center. \nWatch for green down and lock lights on main gear. The tail wheel will likely not come \ndown and lock. It is recommended to hold the tail in the air as long as possible. This can \nbe accomplished through use of brakes and power. In most cases you should be able to \nhold the tail in the air until the aircraft comes to a complete stop, which should result in \nlittle or no damage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0015-A \nDate:  12/1/2009 \nPage:  20 of 20 \nLater Hydraulic Systems \n \n \n \nFigure 5 \n \nFigure 5 shows a simplified hydraulics system using the Parker Hannifin hydraulic pump.  \nWhich has check valves and overpressure switches built in.  This is a much simpler \nsystem and simplifies the emergency gear down procedure considerably.  First double \ncheck, make sure the pump is running.  If the pump is running the gear “in transit” light \nwill be illuminated.  If it is not, double check the landing gear lever position, and proper \nlever engagement, also double check that the circuit breaker is on.  If all fails, it is \nrecommended to open the emergency dump valve.  This will allow the gear to extend \nunder gravity.  If the land gear circuit breaker switch is on the green “down and lock” \nlights will illuminate, when the gear is down and locked.  If you do not have a green \nlight, it is likely that the gear is no down and locked.  Both main gear lights should be on \n(indication down and locked), before attempting a landing.  It’s  likely that the tailwheel \nwill not come down under gravity, because the air loads usually hold the doors closed.  If \nthis is the case, it is recommended to perform a wheel landing and hold the tail in the air \nuntil the airplane comes to a complete stop.  This should result in little to no damage to \nyour plane.",

    "content": "Document No: T51-08-DOC-0003-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 1 of 1 \nFuselage Section \n \nThe fuselage frame comes from the factory in two sections \nthat bolt together aft of the cockpit area. This is done for \nease of shipment. When the aircraft is complete, in addition \nto the bolts, aluminum skins and stringers will hold the \nstructure together. The fuselage will no longer disassemble \ninto two pieces. \n \nThe fuselage frame will need to be painted or powder \ncoated prior to any assembly. \n \nBolt the two fuselage sections together. The fuselage frame \nis not a stable structure until the aluminum skins are \ninstalled. It can twist, bend, and sag at anytime. Keeping it \nstraight during the skinning process is necessary. Once the \nskins are installed it becomes a semi-monocoque structure \nthat won’t twist or bend. \n \nSetting the frame on two heavy-duty saw horses or clamping \nit to a wooden structure should help keep it straight. The \nsawhorses or supports should be placed near cross tubes so \nthe longerons don’t bend. Make sure everything is aligned \nand level at all times. Check level throughout the skinning \nprocess to make sure nothing twists or bends. Setting a long \npiece of aluminum angle on the lower cross-tubes inside the \nfuselage may also help the builder notice any misalignment. \n \nSome components in the kit are either pre-assembled with \nnylon ties or bolted together with finger tight fasteners. \nThose assemblies will need to be disassembled so the parts \ncan either be painted or powder coated. It is necessary to \npaint or powder coat the steel parts. Coating the other parts \nis optional. The fasteners will need to be tightened correctly \nand cotter pins should be used when necessary. \n \nControl Stick Torque Tube Installation \n \nThe control stick parts come from the factory pre-fit to the \ncontrol stick torque tube. This assembly needs to be \ndisassembled and the steel parts need to be either painted or \npowder coated. Refer to print T51-03-INS-0810 for \nreassembly into the fuselage. \n \n \nFront stick mount. Looking down from the right side. \nSD42BS rivets will be used to secure the forward control \nstick mount to the control stick torque tube. \n \nSlide the torque tube forward from the back seat area \nassembling the parts as it goes in. \n \nCAUTION: The aileron driver (MC02-10) should not be \nriveted to the control stick torque tube until the wings are \ninstalled and the aileron push/pull tubes are in place. Slide \nthe aileron driver over the torque tube and let it swing freely \nfor now. \n \n \nStick assembly as viewed from under the front seat looking \nforward from the right side. Let the aileron driver swing \nfreely until the wings and aileron push/pull tubes are \ninstalled. \n \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0003-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 2 of 2 \n \nRear control stick mount. Looking down from the left side. \n \nRudder Bellcrank Installation \n \nThe rudder pedal cables drive the rudder bellcrank and then \nit will drive both the rudder and the tailwheel. \n \nInstalled rudder bellcrank. Looking back from the lower \nright side of the fuselage. (The cable tension has not been \nset in this photo.) \n \nRefer to print T51-03-INS-0811 and to the above photo. \nPaint or powder-coat the steel parts. Prior to painting, be \nsure to tape off the areas of the bellcrank shaft that will be \nin contact with the nylon bushings. Insert the bellcrank shaft \nfrom the top. Install the lower bellcrank (MC02-84) and \nbolt together with an AN3-14A bolt. The cables coming \nfrom the rudder pedals attach to the lower bellcrank forward \nholes. The cables that will attach to the tailwheel attach to \nthe lower bellcrank aft holes. The cables that will attach to \nthe rudder control horn attach to the upper bellcrank \n(MC02-85) aft holes. (See cable-rigging section of the \nmanual for details.) \n \nElevator Bellcrank Installation \n \nThe push/pull tube that attaches to the rear control stick \ndrives the elevator bellcrank. The elevator bellcrank drives \na push/pull tube that attaches to the elevator control horns. \nIt also reverses the direction of the push and pull. \n \nRefer to print T51-03-INS-0811 for details. Match drill the \nsix #30 holes from each elevator bellcrank arm (MC02-81) \ninto the elevator bellcrank pivot assembly (MC02-86). \nDisassemble, deburr, and paint the parts as desired. \nReassemble using SD43BS rivets. Insert the MT03-137 \nbushings. The elevator bellcrank is installed in the frame \njust ahead of the rudder bellcrank. Secure with an AN4-23 \nbolt, AN960-416 washers as necessary, AN310-4 castle nut \nand AN380-2-3 cotter pin. \n \n \nLooking forward and down from the left side of the \nfuselage. Shows elevator bellcrank (dark green) and \ntailwheel hydraulic cylinder. \n \nTailwheel Installation \n \nThe tailwheel assembly can be disassembled and painted if \ndesired.  \n \n \nTailwheel installation.  \nRefer to print T51-03-INS-0816. Assemble the tailwheel \nspring MG01-6 to the tailwheel assembly MG03-156 and to \nthe tailwheel spring bracket assembly MG01-11. Attach the \nentire assembly to the fuselage frame with an AN4-45A \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0003-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 3 of 3 \nbolt, AN960-416 washers as needed, and AN365-428 \nLocknut. \n \nFuselage Hat Section Installation \n \nThe fuselage skins and inner panels will be attached to \naluminum hat sections MF02-109, use titanium silicone \n(MF05-447) to bond hat sections to steel frame. After skins \nare installed this will provide a very rigid structure with a \nbarrier between the aluminum and steel. \n \n \nShows hat section fit from the inside of the frame. \n \nRefer to print T51-03-INS-0963 and photos for hat section \nlocations. Hat sections will be fit to all the square steel \ntubes that support exterior skins plus the locations shown on \nthe print. A band saw, tin snips and files are good tools to \nuse when fitting the hat sections. As the hat sections are fit, \nthey should be left in place on the frame so adjacent hat \nsections can be fit. Inner panels are attached to the structure \nwith channels made from hat sections. Bond all the \nunmodified hat sections in place first with titanium silicone. \nThen fit the exterior skins, drill, and cleco in place. Fit the \ninner panels & match drill using the exterior skin holes as \nguides. \n \nThe skins will be bonded in place later. For now, they can \nbe left clecoed in place and removed as necessary to gain \naccess to components during assembly. \n \nCenter Bulkhead #3 Installation \n \nCenter bulkhead #3 MF03-197 is the wall between the \npilot’s feet and the firewall. This bulkhead must be trimmed \nto fit. It will be attached to the frame by hat sections as \nshown in print T51-03-INS-0820. Several parts will be \nattached in this area. All the parts should be fit prior to the \nfinal assembly of this bulkhead.  \n \n \nLooking back from the engine compartment at center \nbulkhead #3. Arrow shows the location of the center \nbulkhead stiffener below the hat section. Dimension shows \n8¼” from the bottom of the fuselage tube to the top of the \nhat section stiffener. \n \n \nHat section stiffener and center bulkhead stiffener nest \ntogether as shown. Note arrow showing the rudder cable \nanchor eyebolt from the front. \n \n \nLooking forward from the front seat before the center \nbulkhead #3 is installed. Note the hat section locations that \nhold the bulkhead and forward cockpit floor in place. \n \nThe forward cockpit floor (MF03-209) is attached to the \ntwo forward cockpit floor side supports (MF03-210 & 211). \nThe side supports are attached to channels along the lower \nfuselage longeron. The forward floor is also attached to the \ncenter bulkhead #3 at its lower rivet line. \n \nMany sheets and hat sections rivet together in this area. \nLeave the assemblies clecoed together and not riveted \ntogether until it is certain that all the parts are fit. \n \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0003-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage 4 of 4 \n \nCockpit floor area prior to floor installation. The red is \npadding on the sawhorse. \n \n \nForward cockpit floor area after floor and supports are fit. \n \n \nCenter bulkhead #3 and rudder pedal assembly. \n \nThe rudder pedal forward support (MF03-205) is centered \non the backside of the center bulkhead #3. Drill the rivet \nlines with 1½” spacing. \n \nThe rudder pedal tracks (MF03-189 & 190) are installed \nparallel to the forward cockpit floor. \n \n \nThe top surface of the rudder pedal track is 12 5/8” from the \nforward cockpit floor and parallel to it. \n \nTape or clamp the tracks in place with the upper surface of \nthe track positioned 12 5/8” from the floor. Drill two rivet \nlines along each track with holes spaced evenly \napproximately 1½” on center. Rivet the tracks in place \nusing SD41BS rivets. \n \nUpper and Lower Bulkhead Installation \n \nMost of the bulkheads are attached to small tabs that are \nwelded to the fuselage frame and hat sections. Print T51-03-\nINS-0818 shows the locations of the bulkheads by name \nand part number. Match drill the bulkheads to the fuselage \nand rivet them in place. Uralane adhesive or Titanium \nSilicone can be used to attach the bulkhead flanges to the \nfuselage frame. \n \n \n___________________________       ________________ \nBy \n \n \n \n      Date \n \n___________________________       ________________       \nChecked  \n \n \n      Date  \n \n \n__________________________________           ___________________ \nApproved \n \n \n       Date",

The builder \nwill assemble the aft portion of the stabilizer structures and \nattach the skins. Left and right stabilizers are identical until \nthey are match drilled by the builder to the horizontal \nstabilizer spar carrythru in the fuselage. After they are \nmounted, they will no longer be interchangeable from side \nto side. \n \n! CAUTION   Acetone, MEK, lacquer thinner, gasoline, \npaint thinner and many other solvents can destroy the \nEPS foam inside the horizontal stabilizer leading edge. \nWhen cleaning in the area of the leading edge, it is \nimportant to use a cloth or paper towel that is only damp \nwith the solvent. Dripping any solvent inside the leading \nedge through drill holes, around rivets heads or through \nany opening will destroy the EPS foam and severely \nweaken the structure. \n \nDrill all rivet holes with a #30 drill unless otherwise \nspecified. \nMatch drill the leading edge skin to the existing holes in \nthe horizontal stabilizer forward spar using a hole \nduplicator. \n \nInstall the horizontal stab ribs MT03-64, MT03-65, and \nMT03-66 in the locations as shown on print T51-03-INS-\n0821. To locate the ribs, measure from the root end of the \nspar. The inboard four ribs will be installed with the \nflanges facing toward the root end of the stabilizer. The \noutboard rib will be installed with the flanges facing the \ntip. Be careful, the rib location dimensions on the print are \nto the rib web, not to the centerline or flange. The ribs are \nsecured to the main spar with four rivets each. The two \nrivets that hold the forward rib flange to the spar will be \ninstalled. The two rivets that hold the skin, spar and the rib \ntogether will be left out until the skin is installed. \n \n \nThis photo shows a horizontal stab rib riveted to the main \nspar. \n \nAttach the horizontal stab aft spar MT03-43. Measure from \nthe root end of the spars to locate the ribs. Four rivets will \nhold the ribs to the aft spar. Two rivets will be installed \nand two will be left out until the skin is attached. \n \n \n \nHorizontal stabilizer. The skins in the kit are rectangular \nand will need to be trimmed. Elevator hinges are shown in \nthe photo. They will be installed later when the elevators \nare fit. \n \n \nRoot end of the horizontal stabilizer. \n \nIt is important to keep the structure square and without \ntwist throughout the building process. \n \nThe aft skins will slide between the leading edge skin and \nthe main spar. The skins should overhang one-inch beyond \nthe aft spar. Match drill the main spar line. Continue the \nrivet line to the tip of the spar on approximately 1½” \ncenters. Make sure the ribs will be attached along this rivet \nline. The spacing may have to be adjusted slightly to \naccomplish this. \n \nDrill the skins along the centerlines of the rib flanges and \nalong the aft spar on approximately 1½” centers. Cleco the \nskins in place as you drill. After the skins are fit, mark the \nskins where they will be trimmed. Remove the skins and \ntrim to fit. Bond the skins to the structure with Uralane and \ninstall the rivets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTail Section Assembly, Vertical Stabilizer \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0004-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage: 2 of 2 \n \n It is important to level the fuselage prior to the installation \nbecause a plumb bob will be used to set the vertical \nstabilizer in the proper position. \n \nThe horizontal stab carrythru’s must be installed after \ninstalling the vertical structure. Refer to print T51-03-INS-\n0822.  \n \nInstall the vertical stabilizer to the fuselage. Align the base \nrib centerline with the fuselage centerline. The base rib \nattaches in three places. The forward flange (MT04-172) \nattaches to the U12 bulkhead and frame tabs. The aft \nflange attaches to the forward vertical spar mount flange, \nwhich is welded to the fuselage. The base rib web is \nattached to the vertical stab base rib bracket, which should \nbe attached to the fwd carrythru. \n \nThe upper surface of the vertical stab base rib bracket \nneeds to be aligned with the top surface of the fuselage \nupper longerons. Refer to print T51-03-INS-0822. Clamp a \nstraight edge across the top of the fuselage frame and \nclamp the bracket to the straight edge. Match drill the four \nholes from the main spar carrythru into the bracket. Bond \nthe bracket in place and rivet with SD45BS rivets. Later in \nthe assembly, the vertical stab base rib will attach to this \nbracket. Be the top flanges are attached to the carrythru’s \nand the horizontals are built and fitted, before attaching the \nvertical stabilizer rib bracket to the fwd carrythru. \n \n \nMT03-90 \n \nLooking back from the lower right side of the fuselage. \nShows vertical stab base rib bracket. The bracket will be \nriveted and bonded to the center of the horizontal main \nspar carrythru. In this photo the vertical stab base rib is \nalready installed. \n \nDraw a centerline on the vertical stab main spar. Make sure \nthe fuselage is level. Clamp the vertical stab main spar to \nthe fuselage frame. Use a plumb bob to align the spar. \nAdjust the spar as necessary.

Shows \nthe horizontal main spar carrythru and the horizontal aft \nspar carrythru mounted in the fuselage. \n \nOnce the carrythru’s have been bolted in place, slide both \nhorizontal stabilizer leading edges in place on the fwd \ncarrythru and clamp to bottom flange. Position the fwd \ncarrythru’s top flange to make a snug fit for the horizontal \nspars & clamp flange in place. Remove horizontals from \ncarrythru and then slide horizontals back in place to check \npositioning of top flange. Adjust as needed. (There should \nbe no play vertically when horizontals are in place.) When \nsatisfied with the positioning of top flange bond and rivet \nin place, also install required bolts to fuselage. \n \nThere are several small parts that will be attached when the \nhorizontal aft spar is attached to the carrythru. See the \nexploded view T51-03-INS-0844 for details. The bolt \nholes in the horizontal stab center plates (MT03-79, \nMT03-78) and horizontal aft spar carrythru plate (MT03-\n87) will be used to locate the mounting holes that need to \nbe drilled. After the holes are drilled, temporarily install \nAN3-5A bolts to make sure everything is aligned properly. \n \nRepeat the process for the other horizontal stab. Make sure \nthe stabilizers are marked Right and Left before they are \nremoved. \n \nRefer to prints T51-03-INS-0843 and T51-03-INS-0844. \nAssemble the two elevator center bearing brackets (MT01-\n1) to the bearing (MT01-3) with six SD44BS rivets. This \nassembly will be attached with the four AN3-6A bolts that \nalso hold the horizontal stab center plates in place. The thin \ncenter plate (MT03-79) goes between the bearing assembly \nand the horizontal stab aft spar carrythru. The thick center \nplate (MT03-78) will be mounted to the front of the \nhorizontal stab aft spars. \n \nBoth horizontal stab aft carrythru plates (MT03-87) will \nmount to the inside of the horizontal stab aft spars so the \nhorizontal aft spars will be sandwiched between the \nhorizontal stab aft carrythru plates and the horizontal stab \naft spar carrythru. \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0004-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage: 3 of 3 \n \nVertical stab main spar, mounting bolts and rudder hinge. \nThe production rudder hinge looks a little different, but \nmounts exactly the same. \n \nAttach the main spar to the frame at the upper two holes \nwith AN3-6A bolts.

CAUTION   When drilling any holes in the spar, it is \nvery important to drill only holes that are specified in the \nprints and no others. Hole placement is important. \nAdditional or misplaced holes could severely weaken the \nwing structure. If uncertain about hole location, contact \nTitan Aircraft.  \n \nThe wing rib forward flange hole layout (where the rib \nmounts to the spar) needs to be correct because the rib \nholes will be match drilled into the spar. The hole layout is \ndepicted on print number T51-02-INS-0385. Lay out the \nhole pattern with a #30 drill. \n \nLay out the rib locations on the spar as depicted on print \nnumber T51-02-INS-0386. Dimensions are to the wing rib \nwebs with the exception of the #1 rib that will attach to the \nspar web stiffener #1. Align each rib with the layout marks \nand match drill the holes into the spar with a #30 drill. \nCleco the ribs in place until all ribs are fit. Disassemble \nand deburr. Rivet ribs in place using the correct rivets. See \nthe rivet callouts on print T51-02-INS-0386. \n \nNOTE: Rivet callouts sometimes allow either SD41BS \nrivets or SD42BS rivets. At those locations either rivet \nlength may be used. Depending on availability at the time, \nkits will be supplied with SD41BS rivets, SD42BS rivets, \nor both. \n \nFit the aft spars to the wing ribs as depicted on print T51-\n02-INS-0387. Five equally spaced rivets will hold the aft \nspar to each wing rib (35 rivets total, each wing). Use the \nMW02-14 aft spar wing fitting to locate the holes for the \n#1 and #2 rib locations. Use the MW02-43 aft spar doubler \nplate to help locate the holes for the #4 rib location. Both \nthe aft spar wing fitting and the aft spar doubler will attach \nto back of the aft spar (outside the wing). Make sure the \nribs remain parallel. Drill #30 holes and cleco all ribs in \nplace. \n \nFit the MW02-63 RH aileron stub rib and the MW02-64 \nLH aileron stub ribs to the #7 rib as shown. Refer to print \nT51-02-INS-0388. The stub ribs fit over the #7 wing rib \nand under the aft spar. Match drill #30 each stub rib with \nthe holes in the aft spar at rib #7. Drill two #30 holes to \nattach the stub rib to the #7 wing rib. \n \n \nPhoto shows aileron and outer aileron hinge in place. \n \nRivet the aft spar and aileron stub ribs in place with the \nrivets called out on prints T51-02-INS-387 and T51-02-\nINS-0388. \n \nFit the upper and lower stringers as depicted on print T51-\n02-INS-0388. The stringers will have to be trimmed at the \nends to fit the #1 and #7 wing ribs that are not slotted. \nBonding the stringers in place will make assembly much \neasier. A small dab of Uralane adhesive at each rib/stringer \nintersection will work fine. Make sure the ribs are straight \nand 90° off the main spar.  \n \nUse a large square to check the square ness between the \nmain spar and the lower wing rib flanges. The upper wing \nrib flanges are curved and won't allow an accurate check \nfor square ness. Clamp the stringers in place and allow to \ncure overnight. \n \nFit the intermediate webs as shown on print T51-02-INS-\n0388. Do not drill holes in the darkened areas on the print. \nThe flap stub ribs will be attached in those areas later in the \nprocess. Drill #30 holes and rivet the webs in place. \n \n \nPhoto shows the large intermediate web (MW02-137 & \n138) in place and stringers (MW02-141.) \n \nFitting the lower skin at this time will stabilize the \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0005-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage: 2 of 2 \nstructure. Lay out the hole pattern as depicted on print \nT51-02-INS-0541. The inboard skin edge is cut 90° from \nthe spar line at the factory. Use this corner of the skin to set \nthe wing structure at 90°. If the bonded stringers are \nholding the structure slightly out of line, a small amount of \nforce can straighten the structure. The Titanium Silicone is \na little flexible, if the structure is out of alignment beyond \nthe flexibility of the Titanium Silicone, the stringers will \nhave to be re-bonded. \n \nStart drilling at the spar line and work aft. Drill #30 holes \nand cleco the skin to the structure as you drill. \n \nAfter all the skin rivet holes are drilled, remove the skin \nwith outside surface up. Lay out the flap bracket slots as \ndepicted on print T51-02-INS-0542. Cut the slots and \ndeburr. Cleco the skin back to the wing structure. (Do not \nrivet at this time.) \n \nMatch drill and assemble the flap brackets to the flap stub \nribs with clecos as depicted on print T51-02-INS-0543. \nDisassemble each flap bracket assembly and re-assemble it \ninside the wing structure. Center the flap brackets in the \nslots. Using a square, set the flap brackets 90° to the lower \nwing surface, as well as vertically. Drill and cleco the flap \nstub ribs to the aft spar, intermediate webs, and lower skin. \n \n \nAileron bellcrank assembly mounted in the wing. \n \nAssemble the aileron bellcrank assemblies as depicted on \nprint T51-02-INS-0544. The left side is shown on the \nprint. The right side is a mirror image of the left side. Make \nsure the bolt heads are up. \n \nInstall the aileron bellcrank assemblies so they are centered \non the spar. Drill #30 holes. Rivet & bond to the #4 rib and \nspar web. \n \nMatch drill the aileron bellcrank bracket stiffeners to the \naileron bellcrank brackets using a #30 bit and rivet in \nplace. \n \nRemove the lower wing skin from the right wing so the \npitot tube can be installed. Measure in from the root end of \nthe spar along the lower rivet line 5 feet, this should be the \ncenter of the pitot tube. Rivet the pitot tube in place as \nshown on print T51-02-INS-0545. Enlarge the forward \ntooling holes in the required ribs to 3/8\". A step drill such \nas a Unibit works well for enlarging holes in thin sheet \nmetal. Install the grommets and the soft 1/4\" aluminum \ntubing through the grommets. Leave the aluminum tubing a \nfew inches long at the root end. This will be trimmed to the \nproper length when the wing panels are attached to the \ncenter section. Connect the 1/4\" aluminum tubing to the \nPitot tube with blue urethane tubing. \n \nLay out the rivet pattern on the upper wing skin as depicted \non print T51-02-INS-0546. Unlike the lower skin, the \nupper skin will align with the tip end of the wing panel at \nthe spar. There will be some extra skin length at the root \nend. The extra material will need to be trimmed carefully \nwhen the wing is installed on the center section. There will \nalso be several inches of skin overhang beyond the aft spar. \nLeave that extra material until the flaps and ailerons are \ninstalled. Trimming will be necessary at that time. \n \nLike the lower skin, start at the spar line and work aft. Drill \n#30 holes and cleco the skin to the structure. Leave the \nupper skin in place while bonding and riveting the lower \nskin to the wing structure. \n \nRemove the lower skin. Dampen a rag or paper towel with \nacetone or MEK and clean the mating surfaces. Use \nextreme caution with solvents near the leading edge \nEPS foam. Sand the surfaces that are going to be bonded. \n \nUsing a 1/8\" dimple tool, dimple the holes in the wing skin \nwith the exception of the row that will attach to the #7 rib. \nDimple rib flanges #1 through #6, aft spar, stringer, and \nmain spar strip. Clean again with acetone or MEK. \n \nMix enough Uralane adhesive to cover the ribs, stringers, \naft spar, main spar skin strip, and all other non-moving \nparts. Spread the adhesive onto bonding surfaces with a \ntongue depressor or similar spreading tool. Work quickly if \nweather is warm, the shelf life of Uralane is much shorter \nin higher temperatures.  \n \nCleco the lower skin back in place. Install rivets as \ndepicted on print T51-02-INS-0558. Leave clecos in the \nskin at the tip where it attaches to the #7 rib. Do not install \nrivets into rib #7. Later the fiberglass wingtip will be match \ndrilled to these holes. After the Uralane has cured, remove \nthe clecos at the tip. \n \nRepeat the dimpling process for the upper skin. The upper \nwing skin can be left clecoed until the wing panel is \nattached to the center section. This will make trimming \nmuch easier. After a desirable fit is accomplished the upper \nwing skin can be bonded and riveted in place.  \n \nDocument No: T51-08-DOC-0005-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage: 3 of 3 \n \nBefore installing the outer wing panels to the center \nsection, check the fit of the 3/8\" main wing bolts (AN176-\n20 close tolerance bolt). Make sure they slide into the outer \nwing panel main spar fittings and make sure they slide into \nthe 3/8” holes at the center section main wing fittings. \nThese holes were reamed at the factory and should fit very \nclosely. The bolts should not be a press fit, but should also \nnot have any looseness. \n \nInspect fittings to make sure they have no sharp edges or \nburrs. If there are any sharp edges or burrs, lightly wet sand \nthe affected area with #400 or finer sandpaper. Clean the \nfittings with a soft cloth and compressed air after any \nsanding. \n \nTemporarily install a wing in the center section by sliding \nthe outboard wing main spar fittings into the center section \nmain spar sockets. Be sure to lubricate the fittings with \nsome grease to prevent galling the fittings. This is a tight \nfit. Several people may be needed to steady the structures. \nSlide the wing all the way in so the bolt holes align. If the \nwing won't go all the way in, look closely to see where the \ninterference is. Sometimes small spots of adhesive, foam or \naluminum may need to be trimmed or filed. CAUTION: \nMake sure not to scratch or gouge the wing fittings! \nWrapping the fittings in tape prior to trimming or filing can \nprevent scratches. When the holes are aligned, install the \n3/8\" main wing bolts (AN176-20 close tolerance bolts) \nwithout nuts for now. If the bolts don't fit, the wing is \nprobably not all the way in. Do not use a tapered punch \nor similar tool to align the fittings! Using a tapered tool \ndamages the fittings. The wing needs to be in all the way to \nget the bolts in. If the bolts fit when the assembly was \napart, they will fit when the assembly is together \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMatting Wings to Center Section \n \nAll bolt holes for the wing fittings will need to be cleaned \nfrom any debris. Be sure to grease all bolts and fittings \nbefore attempting to install the wing into the center section. \nAll bolts used to attach the wing to the center section must \nhave the bolt heads facing aft. \n When matting the wing to the center section the following \nhardware is required and there are 2 per wing. \n- Inboard (AN3-16A bolt, AN960-10 washer and AN365-   \n1032 lock nut) \n- Center (AN176-20 close tolerance bolt, (4) AN960-616 \nwasher and AN365-624 lock nut)  \n- \nOutboard (AN3-16A bolt, AN960-10 washer and \nAN365-1032 lock nut). \n \n \nThe photo above shows the outboard wing fitting going \ninto the center section.

Much of the structure \nis bonded and permanently riveted together. Some parts are \nfit but temporarily held together by aluminum pop rivets. \nThe areas that are not bonded will need to be removed or \npartially removed during assembly then bonded and riveted \nlater as required. \n \nThe skins have been pre-fit. The leading edge skins and \nlower aft skins have been temporarily riveted in place with \nsome aluminum pop rivets. The skins will need to be \nremoved for dimpling and to allow better access to some \nareas during assembly. If desired, the lower aft skin can \nremain in place to provide stability to the structure during \nsome of the assembly. It will need to be removed for \ndimpling and riveting prior to installing the fuel system. \n \nThe main gear legs are also temporarily assembled. They \nwill need to be disassembled so they can be painted. \n \nMain Gear and Linkage \n \nRefer to print T51-03-INS-0588. Remove the AN3-21A \nbolts that hold the main gear shafts to the main gear shaft \nfront bushings. This will allow the main gear shafts to slide \nback. Several 1.5\" dia. stainless steel shim washers will \ndrop out as the shafts are slid back. Note where the \nwashers are located for later assembly.  Usually, one shim \nwasher will be located behind the gear leg and one or more \nwill be located ahead of the gear leg. These are used to set \nthe endplay. The gear legs should move freely and have \nlittle or no endplay. \n \nRemove hardware and compress upper & lower strut \ntogether and mask anything required before painting or \nremove the scissors (drag link) assembly. Remove the \nAN4-24A bolt that holds the main gear lower weldment to \nthe oleo strut and remove the lower weldment. Using snap \nring pliers, remove the snap rings. Slide the oleo strut \nassembly out of the upper main gear weldment. Paint the \nparts as desired. (If gear legs are disassembled, it is highly \nrecommended to replace all O-rings before reassembly.) \n \nRefer to print T51-03-INS-0588 and T51-03-INS-0589 for \nreassembly instructions. \n \n! CAUTION: When reassembling the oleo strut, be sure \nthe snap ring is properly seated. If the snap ring is not \nseated correctly, the oleo could blast apart with extreme \nforce when it is pressurized and fully extended. Also, if an \noleo is going to be disassembled after it has been \npressurized, release all the pressure, unscrew the oleo \nvalve, and aim the oleo away from anyone, including \nyourself, prior to removing the snap ring. Check all O-rings \nbefore re-assembly, most likely these will need to be \nreplaced. \n \nSlide the bellcrank front bearing and bellcrank rear bearing \nonto the main gear bellcrank as shown on print T51-03-\nINS-0590. Be sure to lubricate the bearings prior to \nassembly. Attach the bellcrank front bearing to the front \nspar with (4) AN3-7A bolts and (4) AN960-10L washers \nwhere the 4 nut-plates have been pre-attached. Slide the \nbellcrank rear bearing back and over the main gear \nbellcrank spacer and into place on the main spar. Attach \nwith (2) AN3-10A bolts and (2) AN960-10L washers. If \nthe spacer is too long, some length may be sanded off so it \nwill fit. The bellcrank should swing freely in the bearings \nwith very little end play. \n \nAttach a 5/16 ball joint and a 3/8 ball joint to each \nhydraulic cylinder as shown in print T51-03-INS-0590. \nTwo jam nuts at each ball joint will allow adjustment at \neach end. \n \nAssemble the two main gear adjusting links. The links can \nbe adjusted by adding AN960-616 or AN960-616L \nwashers as needed. \n \nInstall the over center stop bolts (AN3-3A bolts, AN960-\n10L washers, AN365-1032 stop nuts) to the main gear \nbellcranks as shown on print T51-03-INS-0599. \n \nAssemble the hydraulic cylinder mounts to the main spar as \nshown on print T51-03-INS-0590. Attach the cylinder end \nof the hydraulic cylinders to the mounts on the spar. Attach \nthe rod end of the hydraulic cylinders to the main gear \nbellcranks. Attach the links to the main gear bellcranks and \nto the upper gear leg weldment clevises. The bellcrank end \nof the link will need spacer MG03-127 installed in the ball \njoint so a ¼\" diameter bolt can be used (AN4-14A bolt, \nAN960-416 washers, AN365-428 lock nut). \n \nWhen the gear is fully extended, the link and bellcrank \nshould rotate so they are in a straight line and then over \ncenter to just beyond a straight line. This will assure the \nlink and bellcrank won't reverse direction and allow the \ngear to retract. Over center adjustments can be made by \ninstalling or removing washers on the over center stop \nbolts. \n \nExtend and retract the gear legs to make sure the locks \nengage all the way, to make sure the roll pin contacts the \nsteel plate and to make sure the legs are clear of the return \nsprings. Some adjustments may need to be made to the ball \njoints and over center stop bolts to allow the gear to travel \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0006-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage: 2 of 2 \nthrough its full range and to allow locking systems to work \nproperly. \n \n \nTrimming the Leading Edge Skins \n \nBefore removing any parts, mark them so you will \nremember exactly where they go.  \n \nBefore installing the outer wing panels to the center \nsection, check the fit of the 3/8\" main wing bolts (AN176-\n20 close tolerance bolt). Make sure they slide into the outer \nwing panel main spar fittings and make sure they slide into \nthe 3/8” holes at the center section main wing fittings. \nThese holes were reamed at the factory and should fit very \nclosely. The bolts should not be a press fit, but should also \nnot have any looseness. \n \nInspect fittings to make sure they have no sharp edges or \nburrs. If there are any sharp edges or burrs, lightly wet sand \nthe affected area with #400 or finer sandpaper. Clean the \nfittings with a soft cloth and compressed air after any \nsanding. \n \nTemporarily install a wing in the center section by sliding \nthe outboard wing main spar fittings into the center section \nmain spar sockets. Be sure to lubricate the fittings with \nsome grease to prevent galling the fittings. This is a tight \nfit. Several people may be needed to steady the structures. \nSlide the wing all the way in so the bolt holes align. If the \nwing won't go all the way in, look closely to see where the \ninterference is. Sometimes small spots of adhesive, foam or \naluminum may need to be trimmed or filed. CAUTION: \nMake sure not to scratch or gouge the wing fittings! \nWrapping the fittings in tape prior to trimming or filing can \nprevent scratches. When the holes are aligned, install the \n3/8\" main wing bolts (AN176-20 close tolerance bolts) \nwithout nuts for now. If the bolts don't fit, the wing is \nprobably not all the way in. Do not use a tapered punch \nor similar tool to align the fittings! Using a tapered tool \ndamages the fittings. The wing needs to be in all the way to \nget the bolts in. If the bolts fit when the assembly was \napart, they will fit when the assembly is together. \n \nWith the outer wing panel installed, the center section  #4 \nstrake rib should be slightly inside the outer wing leading \nedge skin. Make sure the rib is square with the forward \nspar. Using a fine tip marker, trace around the inside edge \nof the rib making a line inside the outer panel skin. This \nline will be used as a guide for trimming the outboard \nleading edge skin. \n \nRemove the outboard wing panel and install the center \nsection leading edge skin. This time trace around the \noutside edge of the rib. This will be the trim line for the \ncenter section leading edge skin. \n \nCarefully trim the leading edge skins on both the center \nsection and outer wing panel. Re-install the outer wing \npanel. The leading edge skins should come together just \nbefore the outer wing panel is all the way in. Mark where \nfurther trimming is needed. Remove the outer panel again. \nCarefully sand the excess material from the skin edges as \nnecessary. Repeat this process several times until the skins \nfit together as desired. \n \nInstalling the Center Section Leading Edge Skins \n \nRemove the outer wing panels and remove the center \nsection leading edge skins. Countersink the skins. The \ncountersunk Pop rivet angle is 120°, so use a 120° \ncountersinking tool. Bond the leading edge foam blocks in \nplace. Re-install the #4 strake rib flanges. Bond and Cleco \nthe leading edge skins in place. Slide the center section \nwing skin strips between the leading edge skins and the \nmain spar before setting the rivets. Rivet the skins to the \nribs and forward spar with SK42BS rivets. Rivet the skin to \nthe main spar with SK48BS rivets except for the inboard 4 \nrivets and the outboard 8 rivets. For those 12 rivets, refer \nto the rivet callout on print T51-03-INS-0604. \n \nInstalling the Fuel Tanks \n \nTemporarily install the fuel gauge mount as shown on print \nT51-03-INS-0611. Trial fit the fuel gauge. It will be \nnecessary to file away some of the lower inside radius of \nthe insert fitting with a rat-tail file.  After the fuel gauge \nmount and fuel gauge fit well, remove them and clean any \nmetal from inside the tank. \n \nThe fuel tanks rest on three foam saddles that are supported \nby three aluminum hat section stringers. The lower aft \nskins need to be clecoed in place. Fit the hat sections on 5\" \ncenters as shown on print T51-03-INS-0609 and T51-03-\nINS-0610. From the inside of the fuel tank bay, drill and \ncleco each hat section to the rib flanges. Along each hat \nsection flange layout a drill pattern on approximately 1½\" \ncenters. Drill #30 holes and cleco. Remove the hat section \nstringers and lower skins. Install the fuel tank from the \nbottom. While holding the tank in place, install one of the \nhat section stringers. The tank should stay in place. Install \nthe other two stringers. Slide the three foam saddles \nbetween the tank and the hat section stringers. The foam \nsaddles should be equally spaced and placed without \ninterfering with the drain flange. Cleco the lower skin back \nin place. \n \n \nDocument No. T51-08-DOC-0006-A \nDate: 12/9/2009 \nPage: 3 of 3 \nRe-install the fuel gauge mount and fuel gauge. Adjust the \nangle of the fuel gauge so it can be viewed from the pilot's \nseat. \n \nInstall the inlet tube, inlet adapter, and elbow. Install the \nclear filler tube. The filler necks have been machined .040 \nundersize so the filler caps will fit flush to the upper skin \nwhen installed. Using reference lines, determine where the \nfiller necks will be located. Cut a 1 7/8\" hole for each filler \nneck. The holes may need to be enlarged slightly over 1 \n7/8\" so the fuel caps won't hang up on the skin when they \nare removed. Temporarily install the filler necks in the \nclear filler tubes with the hose clamps left loose. Cleco the \nskins back in place. Adjust the filler necks in the clear \ntubes until they meet with the skin. Remove the skin and \ntighten the hose clamps. \n \nMatting center section to the fuselage \n \nBe sure the clean all holes on the fuselage and the center \nsection from any debris. Grease the bolt holes as well as \nthe bolts before assembling. \nWhen matting the center section to the fuselage the \nfollowing hardware is required and there are 2 per wing. \n- \nFwd & Aft (AN5-6A bolts, AN960-516 washers \nand AN365-524 Lock nuts) \n- \nCenter (AN6-13A bolt, AN960-616 washer and \nAN365-624 Lock nut) \n \n \n \n__________________________ \n  _________________ \nBy \n \n \n \n  Date \n \n__________________________ \n  _________________ \nChecked  \n \n \n  Date \n \n__________________________ \n  _________________ \nApproved \n \n \n  Date",

Install \nfour AN4-13A bolts to secure the assembly in the frame \nand to lock the flap torque tube to the flap drivers. \n \n \nLeft side flap driver and flap motor installed. \n \n! Attention to builders of early kits   Early kits will have \n¼” holes drilled in the flap drivers. If the kit you are \nbuilding has ¼” holes, drill through with a ¼” drill. Attach \nwith two AN4-13A bolts. Cross-drill an additional 3/16” \nhole in each of the flap drivers as shown on the print. \nInstall AN3-13A bolts in the additional holes. \n \nAttach the TE98-21 flap motor (linear actuator) to the flap \nmotor mount (MC03-121). Attach the ball joint end of the \nflap motor to the LH flap driver. Early kits had the center \nsection mount in a slightly different location so washers or \na spacer may need to be added between the ball joint and \nflap driver. \n \n! CAUTION   The ball joint threads and jam nut must be \nlocked securely to the end of the flap motor or it will \nunscrew in flight. Apply Loctite 242 to the ball joint \nthreads and the jam nut before final assembly. \n \nAttach two ¼” ball joints and two jam nuts to each flap \nlink. Install the links between the flap drivers and the flap \ncontrol horns. The flap control horns are attached to the \nflaps at the factory. \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \n  _________________ \nBy \n \n \n \n  Date \n \n__________________________ \n  _________________ \nChecked  \n \n \n  Date \n \n__________________________ \n  _________________ \nApproved \n \n \n  Date",

(MF03-199) \n \n- Remove the center of U5 (MF03-166) for instrument clearance before attaching the \nupper cowling.  The instrument panel face (MF03-135) can then be used to keep (U5) \nstraight while attaching cowling stringer.

    "content": "Advisory \nCircular \n \n   \nSubject:  Certification and Operation of \nAmateur-Built Aircraft \nDate:  9/30/2009 \nInitiated by:  AIR-200 \nAC No:  20-27G \n \n1. \nPurpose. \na. This advisory circular (AC) provides information about Title 14, Code of \nFederal Regulations (14 CFR) part 21, Certification Procedures for Products and Parts, \n§ 21.191(g) for the purpose of operating amateur-built aircraft. \nb. This AC provides specific information and guidance to amateur aircraft builders \non— \n(1) \nCertificating and operating your amateur-built aircraft, \n(2) \nWhat to do and know before building an amateur-built aircraft, \n(3) \nDesigning and constructing your amateur-built aircraft, \n(4) \nFabricating and assembling your amateur-built aircraft, \n(5) \nRegistering your amateur-built aircraft, \n(6) \nIdentifying and marking your amateur-built aircraft, \n(7) \nApplying for certification of your amateur-built aircraft, \n(8) \nFAA inspection of your amateur-built aircraft, \n(9) \nIssuing an airworthiness certificate for your amateur-built aircraft, \n(10) Flight testing your amateur-built aircraft, \n(11) Operating your amateur-built aircraft after flight testing, \n1 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G \n(12) Amateur-built aircraft built outside the United States and purchased by a \nU.S. citizen, \n(13) Becoming a repairman for your amateur-built aircraft, and \n(14) General safety recommendations. \nc. This AC is not mandatory and does not constitute a regulation.  This AC \ndescribes an acceptable means, but not the only means, to comply with airworthiness \ncertification and operation requirements of amateur-built aircraft.  However, if you use \nthe means described in the AC, you need to follow it in all important aspects. \n2. \nAudience.  This AC affects anyone, including aircraft kit manufacturers, \ncommercial assistance providers, and amateur aircraft builders who seek an airworthiness \ncertificate for an amateur-built aircraft. \n3. \nEffective Date.

The information in AC 20-139, Commercial Assistance \nDuring Construction of Amateur-Built Aircraft, has been rewritten and incorporated into \nthis AC.  In addition, this revision updates existing language related to experimental \namateur-built aircraft airworthiness certification to be consistent with recommendations \nfrom the 2006 and 2008 Amateur-Built Aircraft Aviation Rulemaking Committee. \n5. \nCancellation.  This AC cancels AC 20-27F, dated September 26, 2003, and \nAC 20-139, Commercial Assistance During Construction of Amateur-Built Aircraft, \ndated April 3, l996. \n6. \nCertifying and Operating an Amateur-Built Aircraft.  You should follow the \nsteps in Figure 1, in general order, when pursuing airworthiness certification of your \namateur-built aircraft.  A detailed explanation of each step follows this flowchart (see \nparagraphs 7 through 15 of this AC). \n2 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G \nFigure 1.  Certifying and Operating an Amateur-Built Aircraft \nApplicant \nContact the responsible FAA Manufacturing Inspection District \nOffice (MIDO) or Flight Standards District Office (FSDO) (see \nAppendix 7 to this AC for additional contact information) for the \nguidance and information necessary to ensure you understand \nFAA regulations for your project (recommended).  \nSee paragraph 7. \n \nApplicant \nDesign and/or construct the aircraft.  See paragraph 8. \n \nApplicant \nRegister the aircraft using Aeronautical Center Form (AC Form) \n8050-1, Aircraft Registration Application (see Appendix 5 to this AC) \n(recommended 60 to 120 days before you finish construction).  \nSee paragraph 9. \n \nApplicant \nIdentify and mark the aircraft.  See paragraph 10. \n \nApplicant \nSubmit a formal application using FAA Form 8130-6, Application for \nAirworthiness Certificate (Amateur-Built) (see Appendix 6 to this AC), \nto the nearest MIDO/FSDO office.  See paragraph 11. \n \nFAA \nInspect the aircraft and determine aircraft eligibility.  See paragraph 12. \n \nFAA \nIssue a special airworthiness certificate with \nappropriate operating limitations.  See paragraph 13. \n \nApplicant \nFlight test the aircraft.  See paragraph 14. \n \nApplicant \nOperate and maintain the aircraft.  See paragraph 15. \n3 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G \n7. \nWhat to Know Before Building an Amateur-Built Aircraft. \na. A thorough understanding of the terms and their definitions used throughout this \nAC is critical for you to understand and follow its guidance.  Appendix 1 contains the \nupdated definitions you need to know and understand.  Sample forms and letters and \nassociated 14 CFR parts and publications related to this AC are also located in the \nappendixes. \nb. We recommend that before you build your aircraft, you contact your local FAA \nMIDO or FSDO.  Discuss the type of aircraft, its complexity, and its materials.  Provide a \nthree-view sketch, drawing, or photograph of the proposed aircraft project, and an \napproximate date of construction completion.  Notify your local FAA MIDO or FSDO if \nyou intend to use commercial assistance to build your aircraft.  Keep in mind that a \ndetermination of major portion will be made by evaluating the amount of work \naccomplished by the amateur builder(s) against the total amount of work necessary to \ncomplete the aircraft, excluding standard procured items. \nNote:  The major portion of the aircraft is defined as more than \n50 percent of the fabrication and assembly tasks, commonly referred \nto as the “51-percent rule.”  For example, an amateur-built kit found \non the FAA List of Amateur-Built Aircraft Kits has 40 percent of the \nfabrication/assembly completed by the kit manufacturer.  In order to \nbe eligible for an experimental amateur-built airworthiness \ncertificate and per the major portion rule, the fabrication and \nassembly tasks that may be contracted out (for hire) to another \nindividual (or builder/commercial assistance center) needs to be less \nthan 10 percent. \nc. You may obtain ACs and orders on the Internet from \nhttp://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/.  See Appendix 4 to this AC for a list of forms \nyou will need. \nd. The Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) (See \nAppendix 8 to this AC) should be used to assist in determining whether a manufactured \naircraft kit may be fabricated and assembled by an amateur builder in accordance with \n§ 21.191(g).  A copy of the Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist \n(2009) or the Fabrication/Assembly Operation Checklist (FAA Form 8000-38), as \nappropriate, for each kit on the FAA List of Amateur-Built Aircraft Kits can be accessed \nvia the FAA Web site.  You can find the checklist under the “General Aviation & \nRecreational Aircraft—Ultralights & Amateur-Built Aircraft” section under the main \n“Aircraft” topic tab on the FAA’s main Web site at http://www.faa.gov. \ne. Kit manufacturers are encouraged to include, as part of their kit literature, \nrelevant documentation (information packages) explaining the intent and purpose of the \namateur-built rule and the relationship of the rule to the specific kit being provided.  Kit \nmanufacturers that have had their kit evaluated by the FAA should include in their \ninformation packages a copy of the Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly \n4 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G \n5 \nChecklist (2009) completed by the Amateur-Built Aircraft National Kit Evaluation Team \n(NKET) or the Fabrication/Assembly Operation Checklist (FAA Form 8000-38), as \nappropriate.  This information will help you (the amateur builder) understand the \nresponsibilities and limitations under the regulations.  The information package should \nalso summarize the process used to determine the kit eligibility and the inspection of the \ncompleted aircraft. \nf. You should familiarize yourself with the statement you need to sign certifying \nthat the major portion of the aircraft was fabricated and assembled by amateur builders \nper § 21.191(g) (See paragraph 8b(4)) and also indicate any commercial assistance used \nto complete the project..  In addition, you should be aware of the need for flight training, \nas well as the value of participation in the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) \nFlight Advisor program. \ng. Ensure that you understand when you may or may not apply prior FAA policy to \ndetermine if you’ve met the major portion requirement.  Confusion is normally created \nwhen new policy is introduced.  To temper this confusion, the FAA allows the \napplication of prior policy, also known as “grandfathering.”  There are several factors \nthat influence which policy you can use.  You are strongly encouraged to talk with your \nlocal FAA MIDO or FSDO to identify which policy to use in determining the major \nportion requirement.  Review Figure 2 to determine if you can apply prior FAA policy to \nyour project.  Keep in mind the FAA will make the final determination. \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nFigure 2.  Use of Prior Policy \nNO\nNO\nUse Prior \nPolicy \nUse Current \nPolicy \nYES \nYES\nMajor Change to the Kit by the \nManufacturer after Evaluation? \nWas Commercial \nAssistance Used? \nUse Prior \nPolicy \nNO\nNO \nYES\nYES\nNON Evaluated \nKit\nWas the Kit Purchased from the \nManufacturer Prior to 9/30/2009? \nWas Commercial \nAssistance Used? \nUse Current \nPolicy \nKit Was Evaluated \nPrior to 9/30/2009\n \n6 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nNOTES for Figure 2: \n1.  An “evaluated kit” means an FAA-evaluated kit, which may allow an amateur builder to meet the \nmajor portion requirement for a Special Airworthiness Certificate in the Experimental Amateur Built \ncategory, and be placed on the FAA List of Amateur-Built Aircraft Kits. \n2.  “Prior policy” means the policy that was in effect at the time the kit was evaluated by the FAA \n(for example, FAA Form 8000-38, AC 20-27, or Order 8130.2).  AIR-200 will maintain these \ndocuments as part of the Web-based reference materials section concerning amateur-built aircraft. \n3.  “Current policy” means the policy contained in FAA Order 8130.2F (change 4) or later, AC 20-27G \nor latest revision, and the Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) or latest \nrevision. \n4.  “Major Change to Kit by Manufacturer” means any change that would affect the allocation of \ntask credit. \n5.  “Commercial assistance” means to provide assistance with fabricating or assembling amateur-built \naircraft for cash, services, or other tender.  This does not include one builder helping another without \ncompensation. \n6.  The manufacturer of a previously evaluated kit that was placed on the FAA List of Amateur-Built \nAircraft Kits may request to have the kit reevaluated under the current policy. \nh. Ensure You Understand the Need To Properly Document Your Project.  It is \nimportant to document the entire fabrication and assembly process from the beginning to \nthe end, in a continuous and sequential manner.  This is because, at the time of \ncertification, the FAA is required to ascertain whether the amateur builder(s) fabricated \nand assembled the major portion of the aircraft.  Making this finding requires adequate, \nsufficient, and credible documentation.  This documentation should clearly show who \nperformed the task(s), when and where the tasks were performed, depict the methods of \nconstruction and quality of workmanship, and document the use of commercial and \nnon-commercial assistance.  Examples of documentation and methods that can be used \ninclude the following: \n(1) The Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009); \n(2) Comprehensive builder’s logs in any format, to include photographs of all \nthe steps included in each of the listed tasks in the Amateur-Builder Aircraft Fabrication \nand Assembly Checklist (2009), materials and techniques used in construction, as well as \ndates, locations, and detailed descriptions; \n(3) Photographs/video/DVD; \n(4) Drawings and engineering specifications; \n(5) Kit manufacturer’s data, when necessary; \n(6) Relevant documentation (for example, plans) and references (for example, \nhandbooks) used; \n(7) Documentation concerning any commercial assistance used, including \nreceipts; \n(8) Documentation concerning any non-commercial assistance used; \n7 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(9) Part inventories and histories; \n(10) Receipts and catalogs; and \n(11) Logbook entries. \n8. \nDesigning and Constructing an Amateur-Built Aircraft. \na. Asking Others for Help. \n(1) Contacting the EAA.  You can get help and information from the EAA (see \nAppendix 7 for contact information).  The EAA promotes aviation safety and \nconstruction of amateur-built aircraft, and provides technical advice and help to its \nmembers.  EAA technical counselors may be available to visit an amateur-built aircraft \nproject and offer advice on workmanship.  The EAA has advised the FAA that it does not \nprovide technical help on designing an aircraft. \n(2) Asking Other Persons with Expertise.  During construction, you may ask \npersons with aviation design or engineering experience; other builders; mechanics with \naircraft, airframe, and powerplant experience; and other persons with relevant expertise \nto inspect your aircraft.  These persons can inspect the construction of particular \ncomponents (for example, wing assemblies and fuselages) to verify an acceptable level of \nsafety has been met. \n(3) In-Process Inspections.  You should be aware that the FAA will not \nperform in-process inspections during the construction of your aircraft.  Because of this, \nyour documentation needs to indicate in-process inspections by knowledgeable persons \nsuch as EAA technical counselors or certificated mechanics.  All in-process inspection \ndocumentation needs to include dates and names of all person(s) involved. \n(4) Pre-Cover Inspections.  You should be aware that the FAA may conduct \npre-cover inspections at its own discretion during the fabrication and assembly process \nfor the purpose of determining if the major portion requirement of § 21.191(g) has been \nmet.  As with in-process inspections, all pre-cover inspections need to be thoroughly \ndocumented to include dates and names of all person(s) involved.  In no instance will the \nFAA perform any of the fabrication or construction work on an aircraft it is certificating. \nb. Commercial Assistance. \n(1) Receiving Commercial Educational Assistance.  You may receive \ncommercial educational assistance in the fabrication or assembly of specific parts and the \ncompletion of certain tasks or processes involved in the construction of your aircraft.  \nThe FAA may credit commercial educational assistance provided for educational \npurposes toward the major portion determination.  However, commercial educational \nassistance cannot exceed a demonstration on how to perform the task.  You, as the \namateur builder, must still perform the task to receive credit. \n8 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(a) In some cases, this commercial assistance may be provided by \nkit manufacturers or other entities.  You need to notify your local FAA MIDO or FSDO \nif you intend to use commercial assistance in these instances.  Section III of \nFAA Form 8130-12, Eligibility Statement, Amateur-Built Aircraft, contains information \non the requirements to document commercial assistance used in an amateur-built aircraft \nproject. \n(b) In all cases, any fabrication or assembly tasks contracted to another \nparty (for hire) or provided by a commercial assistance center, including commercial \nassistance provided by a kit manufacturer, cannot reduce the amateur builders’ \nfabrication and assembly percentage below that required to meet major portion under \n§ 21.191(g). \n(c) The FAA may elect to view the actual fabrication and assembly in \nprocess at the commercial assistance facility before making the final airworthiness \ndetermination.  This step may be taken to determine whether the planned project can \nmeet the major portion requirement of § 21.191(g). \n(2) Identifying Which Items Can Be Installed Using Commercial \nAssistance.  You may get unlimited commercial assistance for non-checklist items on a \nkit evaluated by the FAA.  A non-checklist item is a task or process that is not listed on \nthe Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009).  These items also \ninclude painting and the installation of interior upholstery or avionics.  Such a task or \nprocess would not be required to be personally completed by the amateur builder for the \naircraft to receive an airworthiness certificate under § 21.191(g).  Other non-checklist \nitems include fabrication of engines, propellers, wheels and brake assemblies, and \nstandard aircraft hardware. \n(3) Notifying the FAA if You Intend to Use Commercial Assistance.  It is \nstrongly recommended you contact your local FAA MIDO or FSDO before using \ncommercial assistance.  You may choose to include a request for a preliminary aircraft \nassessment to determine whether the planned project can meet the major portion \nrequirement of § 21.191(g).  However, this preliminary aircraft assessment will be \naccommodated by the FAA based on the availability of time and resources.  Commercial \nassistance can impact eligibility for an amateur-built experimental certificate as shown in \nthe examples in table 1 below. \n9 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nTable 1.  Use of Commercial Assistance on FAA-Evaluated Kits \nExample of Fabrication \nand Assembly Percentages \nFAA Evaluation \nDetermination \nEligible for \nCommercial \nAssistance? \n49 percent by kit manufacturer \n51 percent by amateur builder \nCurrent configuration of your kit \nmarginally meets the major portion \nrequirement of § 21.191(g). \nNo \n40 percent by kit manufacturer \n51 percent by amateur builder \nCurrent configuration of your kit \nsignificantly meets the major \nportion requirement of § 21.191(g). \nYes, up to 9 percent \n(4) Documenting the Use of Commercial Assistance.  You must submit a \nnotarized Form 8130-12, certifying the major portion was fabricated and assembled for \nyour own education or recreation.  This form also requires a builder to identify if and \nhow much commercial builder assistance was used in the construction of the aircraft and \nto identify the source of the assistance.  Evidence and records need to be available to \nsupport these statements and be provided to the FAA upon request. \n(5) Identifying Circumstances Not Considered Commercial Assistance.  \nCommercial assistance does not include the instance where an incomplete aircraft is sold \nto another builder and the second builder completes the aircraft.  In such a case, the work \nperformed by the first builder or subsequent amateur builders, counts toward completion \nof the major portion by the second builder.  The burden of proof that the aircraft is \namateur-built and eligible for an experimental certificate remains with and is the \nresponsibility of the applicant.  The second builder should obtain as much detailed \ninformation and documentation (see paragraph 7h) from the original builder as possible.  \nIf this information is not available, we may not be able to find compliance to the \nmajor portion requirement of § 21.191(g). \nc. Purchasing Prefabricated or Assembled Components and Materials. \n(1) To meet the intent of § 21.191(g) and to be eligible for an amateur-built \nexperimental airworthiness certificate, you need to present satisfactory evidence to show \nthat the aircraft was not fabricated and assembled from completely prefabricated parts or \nkits.  However, the FAA does not expect you to fabricate every part that makes up the \naircraft.  Items such as engines and engine accessories, propellers, landing gear, rotor \nblades, rotor hubs, tires, wheel and brake assemblies, instruments, and standard aircraft \nhardware (such as pulleys, bell cranks, rod ends, bearings, bolts, and rivets) are \nacceptable and may be procured on the open market (See Table 2 below). \n10 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nTable 2.  Component/Material Use Guidelines \nType of Component/Material \nGuidelines for Use \nAny choice of engine, propeller, wheel, or \nother component \nWe recommend you use FAA-approved \ncomponents (for example, components produced \nunder a production certificate, a technical standard \norder, or a parts manufacturer approval). \nAny choice of materials \nWe recommend you use material of established \nquality (for example, materials produced under a \nmilitary specification, SAE, or AN). \nMajor components from type-certificated \nor experimental aircraft \nYou should know whether the components are in \na condition for safe operation.  This description \nrefers to the condition of that component relative \nto structural strength, wear, or deterioration. \n(2) You should not use materials of unknown identity or quality. \n(3) You may use the Amateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly \nChecklist (2009) (see Appendix 8 to this AC), as an aid to determine if using certain \ncomponents would affect the requirement to fabricate and assemble the major portion of \nyour aircraft. \nd. Use of Salvaged Assemblies from Type-Certificated Aircraft.  The use of \nused or salvaged assemblies (for example, landing gear, horizontal stabilizer, and \nengine mount) from type-certificated aircraft is permitted, as long as they are in a \ncondition for safe operation.  However— \n(1) You should contact your local FAA MIDO or FSDO prior to using a \nmajor assembly or subassembly, such as wings, fuselage, or tail assembly from a \ntype-certificated aircraft.  As an amateur builder, you should be aware that when building \nyour aircraft, the excessive use of major assemblies or subassemblies from type-\ncertificated aircraft would most likely render it ineligible for certification under \n§ 21.191(g). \n(2) You will not receive credit for work done on, or the use of, salvaged major \nassemblies or subassemblies when determining whether your amateur-built aircraft has \nmet the major portion requirement.  This would include any “rebuilding” or “alteration” \nactivities to return these components to an airworthy condition. \n(3) All fabrication, installation, and assembly tasks on the Amateur-Built \nAircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) that you’ve completed by the use of \nused or salvaged assemblies can only be annotated in the “Mfr Kit/Part/Component” \ncolumn. \n11 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nNote:  The definition of fabrication is to perform work on any \nmaterial, part, or component, such as layout, bending, \ncountersinking, straightening, cutting, sewing, gluing/bonding, layup, \nforming, shaping, trimming, drilling, deburring, machining, applying \nprotective coatings, surface preparation and priming, riveting, \nwelding, or heat treating, and transforming the material, part, or \ncomponent toward or into its finished state. \ne. Converting a Type-Certificated Aircraft to an Amateur-Built Aircraft.  The \npractice of performing alterations, repairs, and rebuilding of previously type-certificated \naircraft for the purpose of obtaining an experimental amateur-built airworthiness \ncertificate is not authorized under § 21.191(g).  Such maintenance actions properly fall \nunder 14 CFR part 43, Maintenance, Preventive Maintenance, Rebuilding, and \nAlteration.  You will not receive credit for these actions toward fabrication or assembly.  \nWe will not accept applications for airworthiness inspections on such aircraft. \n(1) This policy has been in effect since 1952 under section 1.74-3 of the \nCivil Aeronautical Manual 1 (CAM 1), which specifically states that “structural \ncomponents of other aircraft may be used [for amateur-built aircraft]; however, it is not \nintended that this provision be used to avoid obtaining approval of major alterations to \naircraft previously certificated in another category….” \n(2) You should use the normal supplemental type certificate process for \nmodifications to these aircraft and they should be kept under their existing maintenance \nprograms to ensure continued airworthiness. \nf. Military Surplus Parts. \n(1) You will not receive credit toward fabrication or assembly for your \namateur-built aircraft project where military surplus, spare parts, components, and \nassemblies are used. \n(2) We strongly recommend you contact your local FAA MIDO or FSDO \nbefore using a major assembly or subassembly, such as wings, fuselage, or tail assembly \nfrom military surplus aircraft.  As an amateur builder, you should be aware that when \nbuilding your aircraft, the excessive use of military surplus, spare parts, components, and \nassemblies may render your project ineligible for certification under § 21.191(g). \ng. Meeting General Design and Construction Requirements. \n(1) Amateur builders are free to develop their own designs or build from \nexisting designs.  We do not approve those designs; it would be impractical to develop \ndesign standards for the wide variety of design configurations created by designers, kit \nmanufacturers, and amateur builders. \n12 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(2) We recommend that you use FAA-approved components, especially when \nyou are building parts constituting the primary structure.  During the certification process, \nyou should be prepared to prove to the FAA the identity and quality of any materials you \nuse. \nh. Designing the Cockpit/Cabin.  When you design the cockpit or cabin, you \nshould— \n(1) Avoid sharp corners or edges, protrusions, knobs, and similar objects that \nmay cause injury to the pilot or passengers during an accident.  If you cannot avoid \nhaving them, you should pad them. \n(2) Install seatbelts and shoulder harnesses. \n(3) Mark and place cockpit instruments and placards so they are easy to see. \n(4) Include a fuel selector so the pilot can control the flow of all tanks.  Make \nsure it’s labeled clearly and appropriately. \n(5) Clearly mark system controls, such as the fuel selectors and electrical \nswitches or breakers.  Make sure these controls are easy to reach and operate. \n(6) Use the sample checklist in Appendix 1 to AC 90-89, Amateur-Built \nAircraft and Ultralight Flight Testing Handbook, to inspect cockpit instrumentation \nand systems controls. \n(7) Place a firewall between the engine compartment and the cockpit or cabin if \npossible. \ni. Designing the Fuel System.  When you design the fuel system, you should— \n(1) Ensure your fuel tank can supply adequate fuel to the engine in all \nanticipated flight attitudes. \n(2) Ensure the fuel system controls are easy to reach and operate. \n(3) Provide a carburetor heat system to minimize the possibility of carburetor \nicing. \n(4) Provide a method for filtering the fuel supply to remove water and other \ncontaminants. \nj. Building an Aircraft Using a Plan. \n(1) Modifying a Design Plan.  If you are working from a design plan and you \nwant to make modifications, you should discuss the changes with the designer, kit \nmanufacturer, or equally knowledgeable person.  You should record in your builder’s log \nany modifications you make. \n13 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n14 \n(2) Buying a Partially Built Aircraft Built From a Plan.  If you buy a \npartially built aircraft built from a plan, you should get all fabrication and assembly \nrecords, such as receipts for materials, the builder’s log, and aircraft, engine, and \npropeller logbooks, from the previous owner.  You should add the construction efforts of \nthe previous amateur builders to your builder’s log to show the construction history of the \naircraft.  This information may help us to determine that your aircraft is eligible for \namateur-built certification (see to paragraph 8b(5) for more information). \n(3) Having Your Aircraft Evaluated.  During final inspection for compliance \nwith § 21.191(g), an amateur-built aircraft built using a plan needs to be evaluated.  The \nAmateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) (see Appendix 8 to \nthis AC) may be used as a guide.  If you use commercial assistance, you may also use the \nAmateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) before construction, \nlisting the tasks or processes where you plan to use commercial assistance and those you \nplan to perform yourself.  You should obtain a written evaluation from the FAA \nregarding the effect the proposed commercial assistance will have on the major portion \nrequirement for the completed aircraft. \nk. Building an Aircraft Using a Kit. \n(1) Ensuring You Receive the Information You Need From Industry.  Kit \nmanufacturers should include a copy of the amateur-built regulation and advise amateur \nbuilders they need to certify that they fabricated and assembled the major portion of the \naircraft construction project solely for their own education or recreation.  In addition to \nthe aircraft assembly manual, the kit manufacturer should reference this AC regarding \nacceptable commercial assistance and the use of a build center for help and instruction \nduring construction of an aircraft.  The kit manufacturer should inform amateur builders \nof the help available through various EAA programs, including EAA chapters, technical \ncounselors, and flight advisors. \n(2) Kits Eligible for Certification.  You should always verify the aircraft may \nbe eligible for certification as an amateur-built aircraft.  Advertisements can be somewhat \nvague, and in some cases misleading, about whether a kit may produce an aircraft eligible \nfor amateur-built certification.  For example, certain kits provide so much fabrication and \nassembly, they preclude the use of any commercial assistance if the applicant seeks \ncertification as an amateur-built aircraft.  Refer to the information in table 3 for more \ninformation.\n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nTable 3 – Certification Eligibility \nScenario \nEligible \nNot \nEligible \nYou are able to show you built the major portion of the aircraft. \nX \n \nThe kit you are using or intend to use is one we evaluated and placed \non the FAA List of Amateur-Built Aircraft Kits.  \n(Note:  We do not certify nor approve kits, kit manufacturers, or kit \ndistributors.  However, we do evaluate kits at the request of the kit \nmanufacturer or distributor, primarily to determine if an aircraft built \nfrom a particular kit may meet the major portion requirement.  Kits \nother than those on the list may produce an aircraft we may certify \nas amateur-built.) \nX \n \nYou used a construction kit containing raw materials and some \nprefabricated components. \n(Note:  The raw materials may include lengths of wood, tubing, \nextrusions, or similar items that may have been cut to an \napproximate length.  We will also accept some prefabricated parts \nsuch as heat-treated ribs, bulkheads, or complex parts made from \nsheet metal, fiberglass, or polystyrene, and precut/predrilled \nmaterial, provided you fabricate and assemble the major portion of \nthe aircraft as required by § 21.191(g), Experimental certificates:  \nOperating amateur-built aircraft.)  In addition, it is important to \ndocument who did the actual work associated with these tasks. \nX \n \nYou assembled your aircraft from a kit composed of completely \nfinished, prefabricated components, parts, or precut or predrilled \nmaterials, and using these materials means you did not fabricate and \nassemble the major portion of the aircraft. \n \nX \nYou hired someone to build the aircraft for you, and hiring this \nperson means you did not fabricate and assemble the major portion \nof the aircraft. \n \nX \n(3) Modifying a Kit.  If you are working from a construction kit and you want \nto make modifications, you should discuss the changes with the kit manufacturer or \nequally knowledgeable person.  You should record in your builder’s log any \nmodifications you make. \n15 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(4) Buying an Aircraft Built From a Partially Completed Aircraft Kit.  If \nyou buy an aircraft built from a partially completed kit, you should get all fabrication and \nassembly records, such as receipts for materials, the builder’s log, and aircraft, engine, \npropeller logbooks, and any other documentation available (see paragraph 7h) from the \nprevious owner.  You should add the construction efforts of the previous amateur builders \nto your builder’s log to show the construction history of the kit.  This information will \nhelp us to determine whether your completed aircraft is eligible for amateur-built \ncertification. \nl. Requesting an FAA Kit Evaluation by the National Kit Evaluation Team \n(NKET) Within the United States. \n(1) Only amateur-built aircraft kit manufacturers may submit a request for an \naircraft kit evaluation.  Reasons for requests may include the following: \n(a) The evaluation of newly developed kits. \n(b) The reevaluation of previously evaluated kits with design changes \n(derivative kits) that may affect the fabrication and/or assembly percentage totals of the \namateur builder. \n(c) The reevaluation of previously evaluated kits that the FAA determines \nmay not meet the major portion requirement. \nNote:  A request for reevaluation is not needed for new owners of \ncompanies that produce a kit(s) previously evaluated and \ncurrently posted to the List of Amateur-Built Aircraft Kits located \non the FAA Web site. \n(2) We will evaluate only those kits for which the manufacturer has submitted a \nletter (verbal requests will not be accepted) requesting an aircraft kit evaluation.  The \nletter should be submitted to the following address: \nFederal Aviation Administration \nProduction and Airworthiness Division (AIR-200) \n950 L’Enfant Plaza SW. \n5th Floor, Suite 500 \nWashington, DC  20024 \nATTN:  National Kit Evaluation Team \n(3) All requests for kit evaluations should include the following: \n(a) Manufacturer name and address, \n(b) Point of contact, \n(c) Primary and alternate phone numbers, \n16 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(d) Address of requested inspection location, \n(e) Date of kit availability (minimum 8 weeks from date of request), \n(f) Kit name and type (for example, Starship 2/airplane, helicopter), and \n(g) Kit model number or other specific identifier. \nNote:  Requests lacking any of the above information will not be \nconsidered. \n(4) We will notify the manufacturer by letter that their request for a kit \nevaluation has been received.  The letter will also provide the specific information needed \nto send the required kit documentation to the FAA (see paragraph 8n). \nm. Requesting an NKET Evaluation Outside the United States.  In some cases, \nforeign manufacturers produce amateur-built kits for sale in the United States.  We will \nnot perform kit evaluations outside the United States.  However, a kit evaluation may \ntake place if the foreign manufacturer has a distributor located within the United States.  \nThe foreign kit manufacturer’s representative will need to display the complete aircraft \nkit at the distributor’s U.S. location.  All of the requirements in paragraphs 8l, 8n, and 8o \nof this AC apply. \nn. Documentation Required When Requesting a Kit Evaluation.  \nManufacturer’s requesting an aircraft kit evaluation must provide their aircraft kit \ndocumentation to the FAA.  Documentation must be submitted in English and reflect the \nnature and scope of the aircraft design and include the following: \n(1) The aircraft’s construction, and weight and balance information; \n(2) The exact configuration as sold; \n(3) Photographs, drawings, detailed parts listings, builder instructions, and other \ndesign, fabrication, and assembly information; and \n(4) Any requirements for special tooling, processes, or commercial assistance. \nNote:  Kits lacking this documentation will not be evaluated. \no. Sending Kit Documentation.  Kit documentation may be sent either \nelectronically (preferred), by conventional mail, or by shipping service.  All hard copy \ndocumentation must be provided in two complete and identical sets.  Hard copy \ndocuments will not be returned to the manufacturer.  The manufacturer is responsible for \nall document shipping costs. \n17 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \np. FAA Receipt of Kit Documentation.  The FAA will verify by conventional \nmail and email to the manufacturer that the required kit documentation has been received \nand is complete.  If the information is insufficient or, if sent by hard copy, is incomplete \nor not identical, we will advise the kit manufacturer that the process may not proceed \nuntil the issue is resolved. \nNote:  For additional information on the NKET, see FAA Order 8130.35, \nAmateur-Built Aircraft National Kit Evaluation Team. \n9. \nRegistering Your Amateur-Built Aircraft.  Section 21.173, Airworthiness \nCertificates:  Eligibility requires that all U.S. civil aircraft be registered before we issue \nan airworthiness certificate.  Part 47 of 14 CFR, Aircraft Registration, prescribes the \nregulatory requirements for registering civil aircraft.  The procedures for registering an \namateur-built aircraft are as follows. \na. When to Register.  We recommend you apply for registration 60 to 120 days \nbefore you finish constructing your aircraft and before you submit FAA Form 8130-6 to \nus.  This should allow you to get your registration information before your \nFAA inspection. \nb. How to Submit Your Application.  Submit an application under § 47.33, \nAircraft not previously registered anywhere, to the FAA Aircraft Registration Branch, \nAFS-750 (see Appendix 7 to this AC for the address).  Include the following in the \npackage: \n(1) Documentation that you own the aircraft.  You may use AC Form 8050-88, \nAffidavit of Ownership for Amateur-Built Aircraft (see Appendix 9 to this AC), or its \nequivalent.  The affidavit needs to state that you built the aircraft from parts or a kit and \nthat the person signing the affidavit is the owner. \n(2) A signed bill of sale from the manufacturer of the kit, if the aircraft was \nbuilt from a kit.  You may use AC Form 8050-2, Aircraft Bill of Sale, but strike out the \nword “aircraft” and insert the word “kit” (see Appendix 10 to this AC).  If you cannot \nprovide a bill of sale for the kit, explain why.  If you are not the original purchaser of an \nuncompleted kit, provide AFS-750 traceability from the kit manufacturer through the \nprevious builder(s) to yourself. \n(3) A completed AC Form 8050-1 (see Appendix 5 to this AC).  Keep the \npink copy for your records until you get your Certificate of Aircraft Registration \n(AC Form 8050-3).  The pink copy and FAA Form 8130-6 are not authorization to \noperate your aircraft. \n(4) A check or money order payable to the FAA for the registration fee.  The \nregistration fee is $5.  If you are requesting a special registration number, it is an extra \n$10.  Therefore, if you submit your registration and request for a special registration \nnumber at the same time, the total fee is $15. \n18 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(5) A special request letter as described in paragraph 9c, if you want a specific \nregistration number. \nc. How to Request a Specific Registration Number. \n(1) If you want us to assign a specific registration number, list up to five \npossible numbers, in order of your preference (see Appendix 11 to this AC).  Your \nsuggested numbers may be up to five characters long, and the last two characters can be \nletters.  There is an additional fee for this service.  If you want to find out whether your \npreferred numbers are available, you can contact AFS-750 (see Appendix 7 to this AC for \nthe address). \n(2) You can reserve a registration number for 1 year; this service costs $10.  If \nthe number is not assigned to an aircraft during this period, you are required to renew this \nreservation every year by paying an additional $10 fee before the end of each \n1-year period. \n10. Identifying and Marking Your Amateur-Built Aircraft. \na. When to Mark.  Mark your aircraft before you apply for an airworthiness \ncertificate. \nb. Required Marks.  When you apply for an airworthiness certificate for an \namateur-built aircraft, you are required to show compliance with the identification \nrequirements of § 21.182, Aircraft identification, and the nationality and registration \nmarking requirements of 14 CFR part 45, Identification and Registration Marking.  \nPart 45, subpart C, Nationality and Registration Marks, provides specific marking \nrequirements for all aircraft.  AC 45-2, Identification and Registration Marking, provides \nadditional guidance.  You should direct any questions to your local FAA office. \n(1) Identification Information.  If you built the aircraft from your design, and \nthe model designation and serial number are not used for any other aircraft, you may use \nwhatever number you want.  If you built the aircraft from a plan or a kit, use the \nidentification information provided by the plan designer or kit manufacturer.  Make sure \nthe information is the same as you have shown on AC Form 8050-88.  Place this \ninformation on the identification plate as described in table 4 below. \n19 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nTable 4.  Aircraft Identification Plate Requirements \nElements of the Plate \nDetails of Those Elements \nType of plate \nFireproof \nInformation to put on the \nplate \n \nName of the builder (not the designer, plans producer, \nor kit manufacturer) \n \nModel designation \n \nSerial number of the aircraft \nHow to put the \ninformation on the plate \nEtch, stamp, engrave, or mark by some other approved fireproof \nmarking method \nHow to attach the plate \n \nSo that it cannot be defaced or removed during normal \nservice, or lost or destroyed during an accident \n \nSo that it is legible to a person standing on the ground \nWhere to attach the plate \nOn the exterior of the aircraft in accordance with § 45.11, \nIdentification of Aircraft and Related Products:  General, as \nfollows: \n \nAdjacent to the aft of the rear-most entrance door, or \n \nOn the fuselage near the tail surfaces. \n20 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(2) Nationality Designation and Registration Marks.  You are required to \npaint, or affix by a way that is just as permanent, the N-number on the body of the \naircraft.  For example, only use paints that need thinners or strippers to remove it, or \ndecals.  Do not use tape that can be easily peeled off or water-soluble paint.  For the \nappropriate location of the marks, refer to § 45.22 and 45.25 for fixed-wing aircraft and \n§ 45.27 for non-fixed-wing aircraft.  For size, follow the guidelines as described in \ntable 5 below. \nTable 5.  Aircraft Registration Marking Requirements \nHeight of Marks \nType of Aircraft \nOther \nAt least 2 inches \nAircraft with the same external \nconfiguration (that is, a replica) of \na small aircraft built at least \n30 years ago \n \n3 inches \nMost amateur-built aircraft \n \n12 inches \nAircraft with a maximum cruising \nspeed that exceeds 180 knots \ncalibrated air speed (207 miles per \nhour) \nYou are required to also use \n12-inch high marks if you will be \noperating your aircraft outside the \nUnited States or Canada, or in an \nAir Defense Identification Zone. \n21 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n(3) “Experimental” Aircraft Designation.  Follow the guidelines as described \nin table 6 below to determine whether you need an “experimental” aircraft designation. \nTable 6.  “Experimental” Designation Aircraft Marking Requirements \nIf you have a— \nThen you— \nnon-replica aircraft \nare required to display the word “experimental” on your aircraft in \naccordance with § 45.23(b).  You are required to place the  \n2- to 6-inch high letters near each entrance to the cabin or the cockpit. \nreplica aircraft \ndo not have to label your aircraft “experimental” if it is a replica of an \naircraft built at least 30 years ago.  However, in such a case, you are \nrequired to include an “X” between the nationality designation and the \nregistration number.  For example, the marking on an amateur-built \nreplica of an antique aircraft would be “NX1234.”  You should use the \nletter symbol appropriate to the airworthiness certificate of the aircraft \nbeing certificated, not the aircraft being replicated. \nc. Passenger Warning.  In accordance with your operating limitations, you are \nrequired to display the following placard in a readily visible location in the cabin or \ncockpit, unless your aircraft has only one seat: \n“Passenger Warning:  This aircraft is amateur-built and does not \ncomply with Federal safety regulations for standard aircraft.” \n11. Applying for Certification of an Amateur-Built Aircraft.  Submit the following \ndocuments and information to your local FAA MIDO/FSDO.  You can get all the forms \nyou need from your local FAA office. \na. FAA Form 8130-6 (see Appendix 6 to this AC). \nb. AC Form 8050-3 (AFS-750 will return this form to you, which you in turn will \nshow to the FAA inspector at the time the aircraft is inspected). \nc. Sufficient information to identify the aircraft, such as photographs or \nthree-view drawings. \nd. A notarized FAA Form 8130-12 certifying that the major portion of the aircraft \nwas fabricated and assembled for your own education or recreation, and that you have \nevidence, such as a builder’s log or its equivalent, to support this statement (see \nAppendix 12 to this AC). \n22 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \ne. A program letter in accordance with § 21.193, Experimental certificates:  \nGeneral (see Appendix 13 to this AC).  With the information in this letter, we can \nprescribe the limitations and conditions necessary to ensure safety.  The program letter \nshould— \n(1) Identify the aircraft (using photographs, for example). \n(2) Identify the purpose of the certificate (that is, operating an amateur-built \naircraft). \n(3) Describe a flight test program that addresses the requirements, goals, and \nobjectives during flight testing, including the area over which you intend to do your \nflight tests (see paragraph 14). \n12. FAA Inspection of an Amateur-Built Aircraft. \na. General Information About How We Conduct Inspections. \n(1) We inspect your aircraft for general airworthiness when you submit it for \nairworthiness certification.  We will not normally inspect it before you register it or \nduring construction, but may if you choose to use commercial assistance.  However, we \nneed to inspect it before we issue your airworthiness certificate.  Standard FAA policy is \nto issue one airworthiness certificate for the aircraft; however, in some cases, we may \nissue a limited-duration airworthiness certificate, which would be valid only for flight \ntesting (phase I) the aircraft.  Upon successful completion of the flight test phase, a \nsecond airworthiness certificate is issued.  When we inspect the aircraft, it should be \nready to fly, except for having the cowlings, fairings, and panels open for inspection. \n (2) The FAA’s ability to inspect and certify aircraft is greatly enhanced by the \nuse of FAA designated airworthiness representatives (DAR).  DARs are the primary \nresource for the certification of amateur-built aircraft.  You may contact your local \nFAA office to locate an authorized DAR.  DARs are authorized to charge a fee for their \nservices, which they set.  We do not govern this fee. \nb. Visual Inspection.  The FAA will conduct an onsite, visual, general \nairworthiness certification inspection of the aircraft, including reviewing the information \nprovided in paragraphs 12c(1) and (2), before issuing a special airworthiness certificate \nwith the appropriate operating limitations.  The FAA will perform the visual inspection as \nshown in Figure 3, FAA Visual Inspection of an Amateur-Built Aircraft. \n23 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nFigure 3.  FAA Visual Inspection of an Amateur-Built Aircraft \nVerify the aircraft registration. \n \nVerify your aircraft includes all required markings \nand placards discussed in paragraph 9, including the \npassenger warning. \n \nVerify to the extent feasible your workmanship methods, \ntechniques, and practices. \n \nVerify your aircraft is in a condition for safe operation. \n \nAsk you to disassemble components if we have a question of \nsafety that would endanger the pilot or the general public.  \nWe usually will not require you to remove equipment or \ncomponents, or to disassemble any part of the aircraft. \n \nDetermine whether you built your aircraft from a kit. \n Yes \n \n No \nDetermine whether you fabricated the \naircraft from the identified kit \nconfiguration, which meets the major \nportion criterion. \n \nComplete the \ninspection, \nensuring you \ncompleted the \nmajor portion. \n Yes \n \n No \n \nVerify the aircraft \ndescription and \nconfiguration agrees \nwith the information \ngiven in the \nFAA List of \nAmateur-Built \nAircraft Kits. \n \nMake an independent \ndetermination about \nwhether you fabricated \nand assembled the major \nportion of the aircraft.  \n(This may prolong the \ncertification process.) \n \n24 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nc. Paperwork Review.  We will review the following information as part of our \ninspection: \n(1) Evidence of inspections, such as builder’s log entries, or EAA technical \ncounselors’ visit report cards describing any inspections conducted during the \nconstruction.  Those entries should indicate what was inspected and by whom (for \nexample, certificated mechanics or other builders/commercial assistance providers), and \nthe date of the inspection.  Include photographs documenting construction details, if \navailable. \n(2) Aircraft logbooks and maintenance records covering the aircraft, engine, and \npropeller or rotor blade(s) so the FAA can review the service records, record the \ninspection, and issue the airworthiness certificate.  We will use the builder’s log entries to \nsubstantiate that your construction workmanship methods, techniques, and practices are \nacceptable, and to support your inspection and airworthiness statement on \nFAA Form 8130-6. \n13. Issuing an Airworthiness Certificate for an Amateur-Built Aircraft. \na. Issuance of a Special Airworthiness Certificate and Operating Limitations. \n(1) In addition to 14 CFR § 91.319 requirements, the guidelines you use to \noperate and maintain your aircraft are included in your operating limitations, which \nbecome part of the special airworthiness certificate.  We may impose additional \nlimitations to those listed in Order 8130.2 if necessary for safety.  References in this AC \nto “phase I” mean those operating limitations that apply to the aircraft while it’s \nundergoing initial flight tests.  “Phase II” refers to those operating limitations that apply \nafter you complete the initial flight tests.  Phase I and phase II operating limitations are \nprovided in Order 8130.2.  The FAA will issue the special airworthiness certificate, but \nits validity will be subject to compliance with its operating limitations.  Those limitations \nwill provide for operation in an assigned flight test area for a certain number of hours \n(phase I) before the second part (phase II) of the limitations becomes effective, which \nreleases the aircraft from the flight test area. \n(2) After we inspect your aircraft and determine it is in a condition for safe \noperation, we will issue FAA Form 8130-7, Special Airworthiness Certificate, with the \nappropriate operating limitations in accordance with Order 8130.2 (see to Figure 4). \n(3) In accordance with § 91.203(b), you are required to display the \nairworthiness certificate in the cabin or at the cockpit entrance so that it is legible to \npassengers or crew while the aircraft is being operated.  The pilot is required to conduct \nall flights under the operating limitations and part 91.  Details concerning flight test areas \nare provided in paragraph 14 of this AC. \n25 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nFigure 4.  Issuing Phase I and II Operating Limitations \nFAA \nPrescribe phase I and II operating limitations. \n \nApplicant \nFly the aircraft over water or sparsely populated areas with \nlight air traffic in accordance with § 91.305, Flight test areas, \nappropriate for the applicant to show the aircraft is \ncontrollable throughout its normal range of speeds and \nmaneuvers and that the aircraft has no hazardous operating \ncharacteristics or design features. \n \nApplicant \nComplete the flight test period. \n \nApplicant \nEndorse the aircraft logbook and maintenance records with a \nstatement that you have complied with the requirements of \n§ 91.319(b). \n \nApplicant \nOperate your aircraft in accordance with  \nphase II operating limitations. \nb. Issuance of a Limited Duration Airworthiness Certificate and Operating \nLimitations.  Because of unique or special situations, the FAA may issue a limited \nduration airworthiness certificate, which is valid only for flight testing (phase I).  When \nyou satisfactorily complete all flight test maneuvers and required flight test hours, you \nmay apply to the local FAA office for a new airworthiness certificate and revised \noperating limitations. \n(1) How to Apply.  Submit another FAA Form 8130-6 and a letter requesting \namendment of the airworthiness certificate and operating limitations. \n(2) Issuing the Amended Airworthiness Certificate and Operating \nLimitations.  After you complete the phase I flight test period, we will review the \nflight log to determine whether you have taken corrective action on any problems found \nduring the flight testing and whether the aircraft’s condition for safe operation has been \nestablished under § 91.319.  We also may reinspect the aircraft before we issue the \nsubsequent airworthiness certificate and phase II operating limitations. \n26 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \nc. Refusal to Issue an Airworthiness Certificate.  We do not certify amateur-built \naircraft designs or require that you modify the design before airworthiness certification.  \nHowever, we may deny airworthiness certification when we inspect your aircraft if we \nfind it does not meet the requirements for the certification you request or is not in a \ncondition for safe operation.  If we deny your certification request, we will send you a \nletter stating why we denied it.  We will put a copy of the letter in your aircraft record in \nthe FAA Aircraft Registry office.  Refer to § 21.193(c) and Order 8130.2 for more \ninformation. \n14. Phase I Flight Testing. \na. Flight Tests.  Section 91.319(b) requires you to show that your aircraft is \ncontrollable at all its normal speeds during all the maneuvers you might expect to \nexecute.  You also need to show that your aircraft has no hazardous operating \ncharacteristics or design features. \nb. Number of Flight Test Hours.  The number of hours depends on your aircraft’s \ncharacteristics.  See table 7 below for specific requirements.  The FAA may decide you \nneed additional hours of flight testing beyond those shown in the table to comply with \n§ 91.319(b). \nTable 7.  Aircraft Flight Test Requirements \nAircraft Characteristics \nRequired Flight Testing \nType-certificated engine/propeller combination \n25 hours \nNon-type-certificated engine/propeller combination  \n40 hours \nGliders, balloons, and dirigibles eligible for \nFAA certification \n10 hours, including five takeoffs \nand five landings \nc. Location.  You may suggest the location of a flight test area to the FAA.  If the \nFAA approves your suggestion, they will specify it in your operating limitations.  \nUsually, the flight test area should be within a 25-statute-mile radius from your aircraft’s \nbase of operation.  Under § 91.305, the flight test is required to be over open water or \nsparsely populated areas with light air traffic so it does not pose a hazard to persons or \nproperty on the ground.  You can ask us to help you pick a suitable area to ensure \nadequate airspace for flight testing. \nd. Procedures.  See AC 90-89 for recommended flight testing procedures.  We \nstrongly recommend amateur builders get a copy of this AC and follow its guidance.  \nAlso, the EAA will help its members in developing flight testing programs. \n27 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \ne. Restrictions. \n(1) Carrying Passengers.  You may not carry passengers while you are \nrestricted to the flight test area or during any portion of your phase I flight test program.  \nWe suggest you use a tape or video recorder for recording readings and other similar \ntasks.  If you need an additional crewmember for a particular flight test, specify that in \nyour application program letter for the airworthiness certificate.  We will list this need in \nyour operating limitations. \n(2) Flight Instruction.  You may not receive flight instruction during your \nflight test. \n(3) Operating Limitations.  When we issue an unlimited duration special \nairworthiness certificate, the operating limitations may be prescribed in accordance with \nOrder 8130.2.  The purpose of the operating limitations is for you to show and maintain \ncompliance with § 91.319.  The operating limitations include a requirement for you to \nendorse the aircraft logbook and maintenance records with a statement certifying the \naircraft has been shown to comply with that section.  The limitations may vary for some \naircraft, and we may issue additional limitations in unusual conditions in the interest of \nsafety.  We will review the limitations with you to ensure you thoroughly understand \neach one. \n15. Continuing To Operate Your Amateur-Built Aircraft. \na. After you complete all required flight tests, hours, and maneuvers, the aircraft is \nconsidered safe for continued flight.  To continue operating your aircraft, you are \nrequired to follow the operating limitations issued with the special airworthiness \ncertificate. \nb. You may not operate your aircraft without the original airworthiness certificate \nand operating limitations aboard.  If you lose the operating limitations or they are \nmutilated or no longer legible, you need to contact AFS-750 in Oklahoma City, \nOklahoma (see Appendix 7 to this AC for the address) to obtain a copy of the operating \nlimitations.  Once you receive a copy from AFS-750, take that copy to your local FAA \noffice to issue an original replacement FAA Form 8130-7 and/or operating limitations.  If \nyou can document that the aircraft has completed the flight test requirements (through \naircraft logbook and maintenance records entries), we may issue new operating \nlimitations without initial flight test operating limitations. \nc. You should be aware of the responsibilities for maintenance and recordkeeping \nas prescribed in your operating limitations. \n28 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n16. Certifying an Amateur-Built Aircraft Built Outside the United States and \nPurchased By a U.S. Citizen. \na. Many civil aviation authorities recognize FAA regulatory requirements and \ncertification procedures and in some cases have incorporated them into their certification \nprocess.  However, some countries’ or jurisdictions’ requirements for certification may \nnot meet FAA requirements.  If you purchase an aircraft from one of those countries or \njurisdictions, you may not be allowed to operate it in the United States under § 21.191(g).  \nContact your local FAA office to find out the exact steps to take to meet U.S. certification \nrequirements.  You should be prepared to send the following: \n(1) If available, documentation obtained by the previous owner from the \ncivil aviation authority of the country or jurisdiction of origin verifying the aircraft was \noriginally certificated as an amateur-built experimental aircraft and that it meets the \nrequirements of § 21.191(g).  If such documentation is not available, you will be required \nto show compliance with § 21.191(g) through the same process used by other applicants \n(see paragraph 6). \n(2) FAA Form 8130-6. \n(3) A record of a condition inspection performed on the aircraft by the previous \nowner, by an inspector authorized by the previous country of registry, or by a \nU.S. FAA-certificated airframe and powerplant mechanic within a reasonable period of \ntime (about 30 days) before you apply for certification.  (Use part 43, Appendix D, \nScope and Detail of Items (as Applicable to the Particular Aircraft) to be Included in \nAnnual and 100 Hour Inspections, as a guide for the inspection.)  Record the inspection \nin the aircraft records. \n(4) Proper documentation of registration under part 47 (see paragraph 9 for \nregistration procedures). \n(5) A letter of request for certification (see Appendix 13 to this AC). \nb. FAA Inspection of an Amateur-Built Aircraft Built Outside the United \nStates and Purchased by a U.S. Citizen.

Requirements and Procedures for a U.S. Citizen Building an \nAmateur-Built Aircraft Outside the United States.  You are required to comply with \nthe civil aviation authority’s rules in the country or jurisdiction where you wish to \nregister and operate the aircraft.  If you want to bring your aircraft into the United States, \nyou will have to apply for a U.S. airworthiness certificate as described previously in this \nparagraph. \n17. Becoming a Repairman of Your Amateur-Built Aircraft.  You can get a \nrepairman certificate under certain circumstances.  However, the only privilege this \ncertificate gives you under 14 CFR § 65.104, Repairman certificate—experimental \naircraft builder—Eligibility, privileges and limitations, is to do the annual condition \ninspection.  The certificate will be valid only for a specific person and a specific aircraft.  \nThe privileges and limitations in part 65, Certification:  Airmen Other Than Flight \nCrewmembers, § 65.103, Repairman certificate:  Privileges and limitations, do not apply \nto becoming this type of repairman (experimental aircraft builder).  To get a certificate, \napply to your local FAA office.  See Appendix 14 to this AC and AC 65-23, Certification \nof Repairmen (Experimental Aircraft Builders), for additional application information.  \nYou can get a certificate if you are— \n30 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \na. The primary builder of your aircraft, even as the second builder, and can \nsatisfactorily prove to us that you can determine whether the aircraft is in a condition for \nsafe operation. \nb. One of the builders of an amateur-built aircraft registered in a corporation’s \nname.  The applicant should prove through use of the builder’s log that they can \ndetermine whether the aircraft is in a condition for safe operation. \n18. Safety Recommendations. \na. Pilot Responsibilities.  As a pilot, you should— \n(1) Be thoroughly familiar with the aircraft, its engine and propeller operation, \nand ground handling characteristics, including operation of the brakes.  You should test \nthese operations by conducting taxi tests before attempting flight operations.  You are \nnot authorized to take off during taxi tests without an airworthiness certificate. \n(2) Take precautions to ensure emergency equipment and personnel are readily \navailable in the event of an accident, before the first flight of an amateur-built aircraft. \n(3) Refrain from aerobatic maneuvers until you have enough flight experience \nto establish that the aircraft is satisfactorily controllable throughout its normal range of \nspeeds and maneuvers.  You should document all satisfactorily conducted maneuvers in \nthe aircraft logbook, flight test program log, or equivalent document. \nb. Operating Limitations. \n(1) The operating limitations require that you operate the aircraft under the \napplicable air traffic control and general operating rules of part 91.  If you plan to operate \nunder instrument flight rules (IFR), pay particular attention to the applicable requirements \nin part 91. \n(2) The operating limitations will authorize all operations to be conducted \n(visual flight rules, day/night, and IFR).  These operating limitations may state that the \ninstruments and equipment mandated by § 91.205(b), (c), and/or (d), Powered civil \naircraft with standard category U.S. airworthiness certificates:  Instrument and equipment \nrequirements, need to be installed and operable.  In addition, these operating limitations \nmay identify flight test are as defined in § 91.305. \nc. Equipment. \n(1) Unless you received deviation authority from air traffic control, if your \naircraft has a Mode C transponder, the aircraft also is required to have a calibrated \nairspeed/static pressure system to prevent an error in altitude reporting.  You should have \nthe transponder tested and inspected under § 91.413, ATC transponder tests and \ninspections. \n31 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G  \n32 \n(2) Once your aircraft has been released from the flight test area, you are \nrequired to have an emergency locator transmitter aboard in accordance with § 91.207, \nEmergency locator transmitters.  An aircraft with only one seat is exempt from this \nrequirement according to § 91.207(f)(9). \nd. Rotorcraft. \n(1) If you intend to fly an aircraft with a fully articulated rotor system, be \nparticularly cautious of ground resonance.  If you maintain or allow this condition of \nrotor imbalance to progress, it can be extremely dangerous and may result in structural \nfailure. \n(2) As a rotorcraft pilot, you should complete tests showing that stability, \nvibration, and balance are satisfactory with the rotorcraft tied down before beginning \nhover, horizontal, or vertical flight operations. \n19.

Total Points for Each Category (columns A, B, C and D).  Each column’s total \npoints are tallied by adding the sum of the points awarded to the tasks in each section (for \nexample, Fuselage, Wings, Empennage).  Include points assigned to additional items in \neach section.  Boxes with a N/A (not applicable) have zero points. \n2.  Total Points for Complete Aircraft Construction.   \nSUM #1.  To find total points, add up the six “Total # of Tasks” blocks at the bottom \nleft of each fabrication and assembly tasks section.   \nSUM #2.  In the FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY SUMMARY section, add the \nfour blocks from each column’s category total (columns A+B+C+D).   \nCompare SUM #1 to SUM #2.  SUM #1 should be equal to SUM #2.  (Verify the \ntwo sums are equal within a deviation of ±0.5).  Total points will vary from aircraft to \naircraft depending on number of N/As (not applicable), and additional items applied \n(123 listed task points + additional items - N/As). \n3.  Percentage of Each Category.  To compute percentages, divide each of the point \ntotals in each column (row 1) individually by the number derived in row 2.  For example, \nif the total points of Mfr Kit/Part/Component category (column A) equals 60 and the \nnumber in row 2 equals 170, then divide 60 by 170 to equal 35.3 percent.  Do this for \neach category column.  Percentages may be rounded to the nearest tenth (for example, \n22.86 percent is rounded up to 22.9 percent). \n4.  Total Percentages for Complete Aircraft Construction as Part of Total Aircraft \nConstruction.  Add the percentages of each of the four categories together \n(columns A+B+C+D).  Total must be equal to 100 percent with a deviation limited to \n± 0.5 percent.  For example, a derived percentage between 99.5 percent and 100.5 percent \nis acceptable.  If this computation falls outside the accepted deviation, then an error has \noccurred in row 1, 2, or 3. \n5.  Total Builder Points.  Add the two point tallies from column C and column D \nderived in row 1.  Total will vary from aircraft to aircraft depending on number of N/As \napplied. \n6.  Total Builder Percentage.  Add the two percentage tallies from column C and \ncolumn D derived in row 3.  Total must exceed 50 percent to be eligible for amateur-built \nstatus and to meet the major portion requirement under 14 CFR § 21.191(g). \nAmateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) (Fixed-wing) \npage 10 of 11 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G \nAppendix 8 \n8-11 \nExplanations and Examples \n►A point (each task equals 1 point) can be divided over multiple categories \n(Manufacturer, Commercial Assistance, Amateur-Builder Assembly, and Amateur-\nBuilder Fabrication) into 1/10 fractions.  A manufacturer may be a kit manufacturer, a \ncomponent manufacturer, or a part(s) manufacturer.  Commercial assistance (for hire or \ncompensation) may include assistance provided by kit manufacturers, commercial \nassistance centers, individuals (for example, A&P mechanics or avionics technicians).   \n►For example, 0.5 point can be assigned to the manufacturer, 0.3 point as commercial \nassistance, and 0.2 point to the amateur builder as fabrication, for a total of 1 point. \n►All points are added at the end of the form in the FABRICATION AND ASSEMBLY \nSUMMARY section under their respective categories.  The point total is comprised of all \nthe credits awarded for primary delineated tasks plus any credits given for additional \nitems. \n►Additional items may be assigned points the same as primary listed tasks if work or \nparts not reflected in the main entries need to be credited. \n►The applicants’ completion of tasks can be documented in a number of ways and may \ninclude the following: \n Comprehensive builder’s logs, to include photographs of all the steps included in \neach of the listed tasks in the Amateur-Builder Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly \nChecklist (2009), materials and techniques used in construction, as well as dates, \nlocations, and detailed descriptions, \n Photographs/video/DVD, \n Drawings and engineering specifications,  \n Kit manufacturer data when necessary, \n Relevant documentation (for example, plans) and references (for example, \nhandbooks) used, \n Documentation concerning any commercial assistance used, \n Documentation concerning any non-commercial assistance used, \n Part inventories and histories, \n Receipts and Catalogs, and \n Logbook entries. \nIn addition to using this checklist, the builder should document the entire fabrication and \nassembly process.  To issue an airworthiness certificate, the FAA must make a major \nportion determination (the major portion of an aircraft was fabricated and assembled by \nan amateur builder(s)).  Making this finding requires sufficient, credible, and adequate \ndocumentation. \nAmateur-Built Aircraft Fabrication and Assembly Checklist (2009) (Fixed-wing) \npage 11 of 11 \n9/30/2009 \nAC 20-27G \nAppendix 9 \nAPPENDIX 9.

This follows the same \nbreak in procedure as the Rotax manual.  Refer to the Rotax manual for additional \ninformation.  The chart provided in this manual provides space for gauge readings and \nlocation for any notes regarding engine run up and performance. \n \nThe aircraft statistics page is provided to record engine and aircraft data at different \npropeller pitch settings.  This will be helpful in determining the pitch for your \nengine/aircraft/propeller combination and will provide a useful reference for future \npropeller changes. \n \nA maintenance schedule has been provided and should be used as an aid in developing \na regular maintenance program for the aircraft.  The maintenance inspection program \nshould go much more in depth than the preflight inspection.  During the maintenance \ninspection look for elongated holes, flaws in parts such as bends and cracks and part \nwear.  Chipped paint may have resulted from part bending or stretching and is a good \nindicator of problems.  Also, check all cables and nico connections for wear and \ntightness.  The maintenance schedule lists a part or system followed by important areas \nto check on that part or system.  First, inspect the entire part or system for \nabnormalities, if it checks ok, then double check for the details that follow.  The \ninspection should be completed before the initial flight and every 25 hours thereafter.  \nPlease follow the maintenance schedules provided by the engine and propeller \nmanufacturers. \n \nAlso provided are regular logs for the aircraft, engine and propeller.  These logs should \ncontain information regarding any repairs, changes or modifications made to that \nsystem.  The more complete and accurate the logs are kept, the better they will aid in \nany future problems or modifications. \n \nThe aircrafts interior and exterior can be cleaned with soap and water.  When cleaning \nthe interior, avoid getting any water on the electrical system and dry the interior when \ncomplete.  Do not scrub the Lexan surface with soap and water.  If the Lexan needs \nmore than a rinse, it may be cleaned with furniture polish and a soft cloth or shammy.",

Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nSINGLE PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n \n \nThe following is a brief description of the assembly process.  This text is designed to \ngive you the order in which the aircraft should be assembled.  It will also call out \nimportant notes and help clear up complicated areas of the instructional drawings.  This \ntext is designed to supplement the drawings. \n \nFirst, place the fuselage in an upside down position.  This is best accomplished by \nsupporting the fuselage at the engine mounts and nose.  The fuselage should be stable, \nas it will be drilled into during the assembly process. \n \nNext, locate the belly skin instructions, drawing numbers B92-INS-0249 and B92-INS-\n0250.  At this time you will want to fit the skins to the fuselage and drill all the necessary \nmounting holes.  Once the skins are completely fitted to the fuselage, remove them and \ndeburr all the drilled holes.  At this point the fuselage should be cleaned and degreased \nfor painting.  The fuselage must be degreased as a light coat of oil may have been \napplied to prevent rusting.  Do not permanently install the skins until the entire fuselage \ninterior has been built, as the skins will become an obstacle for later assemblies. \n \nThe next step is to install the nose fork and steering arm.  Locate drawing number B92-\nINS-0176.  An important point that may be highlighted on the drawing is drilling through \nthe steering arm and nose fork at a 45-degree angle.  Also, ensure that the nose fork \nand steering arm ride on the nylon bushings and do not ride on any other metal surface.  \nThis prevents excessive wear on the parts. \n \nInstall the brake shoe assembly to the spindle assembly.  Drawing number B92-INS-\n0178 explains this.  Drawing number B92-INS-0179 may provide a useful reference and \nwill be used for installing the gear legs.  There is a very important sentence buried \nwithin the notes section that states, “Insert the bolts from the brake shoe side”.  This \nprevents the brake drum (installed later) from riding on the bolts.  Once the brake shoes \nare installed, the gear legs can be bolted onto the fuselage.  Ensure that there is exactly \n12 inches between the spindle assembly and the main gear tube.  A small difference \nbetween the gear legs will become large at the wingtips of the aircraft.  Care must also \nbe taken when sighting through the axles, as the gear legs must be aligned with each \nother.  If you do not feel comfortable with the sighting method, the standard “Plumb \nBob” method may be used.  Also, note the crossing patterns of the bolts are not 90 \ndegrees to one another.  Finally, install the wheels to the gear legs and nose fork.  \nRefer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0331 and B92-INS-0332 for this procedure. \n \nThe fuselage should remain in its upside down position for the next few steps.  This \nkeeps assemblies at an easier level to work at.  Note, the drawings are in their right side \nup position. \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nSINGLE PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nLocate drawing number B92-INS-0177, rudder pedal assembly instructions.  Rudder \npedal assembly in straight forward while allowing for steering ratio adjustments and \npedal positioning for shorter and taller pilots.  A few points to call out, pedals and pedal \nstand must be reamed to 1/2 inch, the push/pull rods may need to be trimmed \ndepending on the location the pedals are mounted to the pedal stand and each end of \nthe push/pull rods must be tapped 1/4-28. \n \nNext, install the control stick assembly using drawing number B92-INS-0180.  The \ntorque tube should ride on the nylon bushings only and not any metal surfaces.  The \ncontrol mixer and control stick mount should both be mounted flush with the ends of the \ntorque tube.  The torque tube retainer should sandwich the nylon bushing between the \ncontrol stick mount.  To prevent push/pull tube interference, use only the specified rivets \nand do not rivet through the top or bottom of the torque tube. \n \nThe next step is rather simple—installing the nylon main control guide to the main gear \ntube weldment and installing the forward control guide to the cable guide bracket that is \nwelded to the seat frame.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0196 for details. \n \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0182.  For bonding purposes, sand the inside \nsurface of the forward and aft sockets.  This is completed while the fuselage is upside \ndown to provide easy access to the sockets.  Do not permanently install the tail boom at \nthis point. \n \nNext, place fuselage in its upright position for the installation of the tail boom, vertical \nand strake assemblies.  Locate drawing numbers B92-INS-0182 and B92-INS-0183 for \ndetails.  First install and align the tail boom.  During this process make sure the fuselage \nremains level.  All lubricant must be removed from the tail boom and both sockets \nbefore bonding.  Next, install the vertical and strake.  Note that the strake is only riveted \nto a height of 15 inches above the tail boom. \n \nThe next step is to route the rudder cables through the fuselage.  Drawing number B92-\nINS-0190 will be used for actual cable routing and B92-INS-0191 will be used for \nmounting the rudder cable to the rudder control arm.  At this point, do not mount the \nrudder control arm to the rudder or the opposite end of the rudder cables to the rudder \npedals. \n \nConstruction of the stabilator is the next step.  You will need to locate drawing number \nB92-INS-0184 for this process.  Even tough the stabilator leading edge had been \nfactory assembled, the rivet line that runs down the spar centerline must be installed.  \nFollow the dimensions so that the rivets will clear the spar lightening holes.  Also note \nthe gussets placed at the center rib and spar.  The bottom gusset should be radiused as \nshown.  This provides clearance for the anti-servo push/pull rod.  After completion of the \nstabilator, the anti-servo tab should be temporarily installed, using drawing number B92-\nINS-0188. \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nSINGLE PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nNow install the stabilator mount ring.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0185.  Once \nagain, ensure the fuselage remains level for this procedure.  Also, double-check the \nstabilator’s level and alignment before drilling.  At this time, permanently install the \nstabilator mount ring, but not the stabilator, as it will be removed later to gain access to \nthe tail boom interior. \n \nThe anti-servo control system is installed next.  Drawing numbers B92-INS-0181 and \nB92-INS-0186 will be needed.  Most of the parts that mount in the tail boom are factory \nassembled to the trim torque tube.  Slide the trim torque tube into the rear of the tail \nboom and out the front through the main control guide and into the fuselage.  Position \nthe components in the tail boom as shown in drawing number B92-INS-0181.  Next, \nmount the trimwheel to the seat frame as detailed in drawing number B92-INS-0186.  \nOnce everything is in proper position, it may then be permanently installed.  The trim \ntorque tube should run under the rudder control arm. \n \nThe tail wheel should be mounted next.  This is a simple procedure.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0195.   \n \nLocate drawing numbers B92-INS-0189 and B92-INS-0190.  Mount the brake pedals to \nthe rudder pedals, making sure they will clear all obstacles such as the rudder pedals \nand fuselage frame.  When “sandwiching” the brake pedals between two rivets, ensure \nthe pedals swing easily, but do not slide side to side.  Next, route the brake cable \nsheathing as illustrated in drawing number B92-INS-0190.  Insert the brake cable \nthrough the sheathing and mount the cable as described in drawing number B92-INS-\n0189.   \n \nThe rudder cables should be completed using drawing numbers B92-INS-0190, B92-\nINS-0191 and B92-INS-0194.  First, temporarily install the rudder.  The rudder cables \nshould already be routed through the tail boom.  Make sure they did not tangle with the \ntrim torque tube.  Route the cables through the fuselage, installing the turnbuckles and \nfinally mounting the cables to the rudder pedal via the rudder pedal tang.  Note that the \nrudder pedals and rudder should be in neutral position during the assembly process. \n \nRoute stabilator control cables next, referring to drawing numbers B92-INS-0190 and \nB92-INS-0260.  Route cables through tail boom so that they do no ride on any other \nmetal surfaces (other cables, rudder control arm, etc.).  Next, mount one end of the \ncables to the stabilator.  Temporarily mount the stabilator to the stabilator mount ring, \ninstall turnbuckles and finally mount cables to elevator driver.  Ensure the cables are set \nto neutral position as described in the drawing and then check for full stabilator \ndeflection.  If full deflection is not achieved, adjust cables while continuing to keep them \nin neutral position, until full deflection is reached.   \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nSINGLE PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nWhile the stabilator is mounted to the tail ring, install the anti-servo push/pull rod.  Refer \nto drawing number B92-INS-0187.  The push/pull rod should run inline with the tail \nboom.  Position the anti-servo control horn accordingly.  The forward most rivet hole of \nthe control horn receives a larger rivet than the other three.  Now that the anti-servo \npush/pull rod is installed, position the stabilator to its full upward deflection.  On the \ncenter rib, mark the position that the push/pull rod would exit the stabilator.  The rib \nshould be marked on its top and bottom side.  Repeat for the stabilator’s full downward \ndeflection.  These marks will be used later so that a slot can be cut into the fabric \ncovering. \n \nInstall the fuel tank mount next using drawing number B92-INS-0252.  The fuel tank \nmount should not extend beyond the indicated fuselage tube, as it would interfere with \nthe jump seat option or any covering that may be constructed to give the fuselage a \nfinished look. \n \nThe flap detent strip may be installed at this time.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-\n0237.  This is a very simple procedure. \n \nInstallation of the instrument panel and hood is next.  Refer to drawing number B92-\nINS-0266 for installation instructions.  When laying out the instruments onto the \ninstrument panel, use extra care to prevent the instruments from colliding with any of \nthe fuselage tubes.  The instrument panel may be as tall as needed, but ensure the \npilot’s legs will comfortably fit under the panel.  Do not permanently install the \ninstrument panel at this time; access to the rear of the panel is need for wiring \npurposes. \n \nFor wiring, temporarily mount the engine to the fuselage referencing drawing number \nB92-INS-0256.  The muffler does not need to be installed at this time.  Using drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0197, install the throttle handle and throttle cable.  Note, the throttle \ncable is sheathed from the cable’s stops to the engine.  Also, note that the engine will \nhave to be removed later for fabric covering purposes. \n \nThere are three different wiring diagrams included with the instruction book.  Drawing \nnumber B92-DT-0366 is for Rotax 503 engines with electric start and wiring for strobe \nand navigational lights.  B92-DT-0248 is for Rotax 503 engines without electric start.  \nDrawing number B92-DT-0251 is a diagram of the mag switches pinout and switch \ncondition of each key position.  All of the wiring diagrams and information contained on \nthe diagrams may not apply to each aircraft, as it depends on which options have been \nordered.  Install the electrical connectors provided in the kit, near the engine and \noutside the aircraft.  This makes engine removal much easier.  The brown ground wire \nattached to the engine must be removed and replaced with an 8-gauge wire.  This is \nespecially true for electric start engines as the amperage capacity of the thinner brown \nwire is not adequate for the amount of current required.  Extra aluminum sheet metal \nhas been provided so that a plate may be fabricated to mount the electrical terminal  \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nSINGLE PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nblock, regulator rectifier and Hobbs meter.  This plate best fits in the upper left corner of \nthe fuselage down tube and the cross tube just below the aft left wing fitting.  Two studs \nhave been welded into the fuselage frame for grounding purposes.  One stud is located \nnear the instrument panel and the other is located in the aft fuselage area.  It is \nimportant to identify all wires at this time; this will prevent future confusion and will be a \nvaluable tool in troubleshooting. \n \nThe belly skins may now be permanently installed.  Once again, use drawing numbers \nB92-INS-0249 and B92-INS-0250.  Only the pre-drilled mounting holes should be \nriveted.  Do not rivet the nose area or above the longeron tubes.  The forward skin \nshould overlap the aft skin. \n \nNext, install the nose cone and pitot tube.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0269.  \nWhen cutting out the slot on the bottom of the nose cone, ensure that it is along the \ninner edge of the fuselage tubes.  To protect the pitot tube from inadvertent damage, do \nnot allow it to extend beyond the front edge of the nose cone.  The nose cone may be \npermanently installed at this time.  The nose cone should overlap the forward belly skin. \n \nInstallation of the left window is the next step.  Use drawing number B92-INS-0313 for \nthis procedure.  The notes on the drawing are the steps for installing the window.  \nPlease read and follow them carefully.  The better the window is clamped to the \nfuselage, the closer to actual shape it will be.  This will make the assembly process \nmuch easier.  Do not drill near the wing fittings.  This may degrade the structural \nintegrity of the aircraft and eventually cause failure.  The Lexan strip that runs down the \nforward down tube serves as a spacer for the front door.  Do not permanently install the \nwindow at this time.  \n \nNext, install the upper right window and moldings.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-\n0315 for details.  This window and molding installation should be much easier than the \nleft window.  Once again, take time to install them correctly and follow the steps in the \ndrawing.  Do no permanently mount the windows at this time. \n \nLocate drawing number B92-INS-0317 for the installation of the front door.  Follow the \nsteps outlined in the drawing.  For the best appearance, ensure the door skin is aligned \nwith the belly skin on the opposite side of the aircraft.  The 1/4-inch gap between the \ndoorframe and fuselage frame is to prevent the door from catching on the fuselage \nduring use.  Removing the left window at the time of the door window installation allows \nclamping of the door window to the fuselage down tube.  The hinge should overlap the \ndoor window.  Do not permanently install the door skin or window at this time. \nThe rear door should be installed next using drawing number B92-INS-0319.  As with \nthe front door, there must be a 1/4-inch gap between the two frames.  Again, follow the \nsteps in the drawing.  Also, notice the hinge mounting detail in the lower left corner of \nthe drawing.  Do not permanently install the door at this time. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

First remove the windows, doors, stabilator, \nrudder and engine.  At this time apply the stits material to the rudder, stabilator and the \naft portion of the fuselage.  Use drawing number B92-INS-0312 for the layout of the \ncovering fabric.  Refer to the stits manual provided for actual covering procedure.  After \nthe fabric has been installed, the aircraft rudder, stabilator, door skins and window \nmoldings may then be painted.  Do not get any acetone, paint or paint thinner on any \nplastic, foam, or other synthetic parts as it will destroy those materials. \n \nAfter the aircraft has been painted, the rudder, stabilator, engine, windows and doors \nmay be permanently installed.  Make sure flap detent is mounted before installing the \nleft window.  Refer back to the appropriate drawings for details.  The windows may be \nsealed with silicone to prevent any water leakage.   \n \nAlso, upon final assembly of the windows, the wing gap seal must be installed.  Refer to \ndrawing number B92-INS-0320 for details.   \n \nAfter the doors have been permanently installed, the door latches may then be installed.  \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0241 for the front door latch and drawing number \nB92-INS-0243 for the rear door latch.  The heads of the rivets that mount on the \nfuselage exterior (for the rear door latch) may be painted before installation or touched \nup after installation. \n \nInstall the cable tunnel next.  Use drawing number B92-INS-0322.  The narrow end of \nthe cable tunnel should mount flush against the landing gear truss. \n \nIf applicable, install the pulley and guides for the pull start rope.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B93-INS-0333.  At this point, only mount the push/pull tube to the control mixer. \n \nThe wing may now be mounted to the fuselage.  If the wing has not been assembled, \nplease turn to that section of the manual.  See drawing number B92-INS-0321 for wing \nmounting details.  It is normal to have some play between the two pairs of forward wing \nfittings.  Do not over tighten the nuts and bolts causing the wing fittings to bend.  Next \nmount the rear wing fittings to the wing.  Now that the wing has been mounted, the \naluminum gap seal may be installed.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0322.  Be sure \nto only rivet the gap seal to the wing.  The main aileron push/pull tube may now be \nmounted to the aileron torque tube drivers.  Refer to drawing B92-INS0333.  Ailerons \nand control stick must be kept in neutral position.",

The following are some general \nnotes and guidelines regarding aircraft assembly. \n \nThe first step in the assembly process is to sit down and read through the entire \ninstruction packet.  This is necessary for two reasons.  First is to familiarize yourself with \nthe aircraft and its assemblies and second, to get comfortable with our somewhat \nunique style of instructions and to be able to find information form their pages as \nneeded. \n \nA brief description of out part number system is also needed.  Here is a sample number: \n \nTG92-16 \n \n“T” designates Tornado parts \n \n“G” represents the location on the aircraft: \n \nC = Control System \nE = Instrumentation & Wiring \nF = Fuselage \nG = Landing Gear \nH = Hardware \nP = Engine and Prop \nT = Tail \nW = Wing \n \n“92” is the year in which the number was assigned \n \n“16” is the part number \n \nWhen the construction process has begun, we recommend that every assembly be test \nfitted with clecos before final assembly.  Most instruction pates do no mention this, but it \nmust be done to ensure proper fit and alignment of the parts. \n \nWe recommend that a #30 split point drill bit be used for drilling rivet holes.  A split point \ndrill will not wander when you begin drilling.  We also recommend the purchase of a \nlong #30 split point drill.  This will aid in such areas as wing and stabilator construction. \n \n \n \nAll parts, especially drilled holes, must be deburred to prevent stress risers and crack \npropagation, which could cause part failure.  To remove burrs from sheet metal, use a \ndeburring tool or sandpaper, and for drilled holes use a deburring tool or 1/2\" drill bit. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nINTRODUCTION \n(Continued) \n \nAll parts that are bonded together with epoxy or Uralane 8089 must have their mating \nsurfaces sanded and degreased.  Sanding parts provides a somewhat rough surface for \nthe epoxy or Uralane to grab.  Sanding also removes the oxidation layer from aluminum \nparts that provides a stronger bond.  For this reason, aluminum parts can be degreased \nwith either acetone or lacquer thinner.  Do not allow acetone, lacquer thinner or other \nsolvents to come in contact with any Lexan, wing D-Cell or other plastic and foam parts, \nas solvents will destroy most synthetic materials. \n \nTo provide corrosion resistance, all parts maybe painted.  For steel, use any rust \npreventative paint.  Aluminum parts should be painted with a two-part epoxy or zinc \ncromate system. \n \nAll moving parts must be lubricated.  This includes cables where they ride through their \nguides, nico thimbles and shackles.  This will provide much smoother operation and \nslow the wearing process of parts. \n \nOnce again, please read and understand the instruction packet before beginning to \nbuild the aircraft.  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

This text is designed to \ngive you the order in which the aircraft should be assembled.  It will also call out \nimportant notes and help clear up complicated areas of the instructional drawings.  This \ntext is designed to supplement the drawings. \n \nFirst, place the fuselage in an upside down position.  This is best accomplished by \nsupporting the fuselage at the engine mounts and nose.  The fuselage should be stable, \nas it will be drilled into during the assembly process. \n \nNext, locate the belly skin instructions, drawing numbers B92-INS-0254 (use B05-INS-\n1435 for SS model), and B92-INS-0255.  Caution:  Make sure the aft edges of the aft \nbelly skin extend 1 1/2\" past the steel frame tubes.  Later in the assembly process, the \nfiberglass aft panel will fit under the extended edges.  At this time you will want to fit the \nskins to the fuselage and drill all the necessary mounting holes.  Once the skins are \ncompletely fitted to the fuselage, you need to take a marker and go along the outside \nedge of the tubes to mark the final trim on the belly skins.  The less skin material you try \nto roll over the better the fit.  Keep in mind you need approximately 4” above the \nlongeron tube on the left side only and 1/4\" minimum edge distance for rivets.  Remove \nthe skins and deburr all the drilled holes.  At this point the fuselage should be cleaned \nand degreased for painting.  The fuselage must be degreased as a light coat of oil may \nhave been applied to prevent rusting.  Do not permanently install the skins until the \nentire fuselage interior has been built, as the skins will become an obstacle for later \nassemblies. \n \nThe next step is to install the nose fork and steering arm.  Locate drawing number B92-\nINS-0176.  An important point that may be highlighted on the drawing is drilling through \nthe steering arm and nose fork at a 45-degree angle.  Also, ensure that the nose fork \nand steering arm ride on the nylon bushings and do not ride on any other metal surface.  \nThis prevents excessive wear on the parts. \n \nInstall the brake shoe assembly to the spindle assembly.  Drawing number B92-INS-\n0178 explains this.  Drawing number B92-INS-0272 may provide a useful reference and \nwill be used for installing the gear legs.  There is a very important sentence buried \nwithin the notes section that states, “Insert the bolts from the brake shoe side”.  This \nprevents the brake drum (installed later) from riding on the bolts.   \n \nOnce the brake shoes are installed, the gear legs can be bolted onto the fuselage.  The \ntolerance on the fiberglass gear legs is very loose.  We have found that this style of leg \nworks best with a snug fit.  This may require some shimming.  Aluminum tape and/or \nmylar have proven acceptable, since the gear leg must also remain removable.  If \napplicable, the titanium main landing gear leg assemblies have been pre-fitted and pre-\ndrilled at the factory.  Slide the gear leg assemblies into the fuselage frame and attach \nthem with the AN4-21A bolts, AN960-416 washers, and AN365-428 nuts.  Ensure that \nthere is exactly 10 inches between the spindle assembly and the main gear tube.   \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nTWO PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nA small difference between the gear legs will become large at the wingtips of the \naircraft.  Care must also be taken when sighting through the axles, as the gear legs \nmust be aligned with each other.  If you do not feel comfortable with the sighting \nmethod, the standard “Plumb Bob” method may be used.  Also, note the crossing \npatterns of the bolts are not 90 degrees to one another.  Finally, install the wheels to the \ngear legs and nose fork.  Refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0331 and B92-INS-0332 \nfor this procedure. \n \nIf you have the Matco hydraulic brake option, make sure to assemble the wheels and \nbrakes using the Matco instructions.  Although Matco wheels come with an o-ring so \nthey can be used with tubeless tires, we provide tubes and suggest they be used to \nincrease reliability. \n \nThe fuselage should remain in its upside down position for the next few steps.  This \nkeeps assemblies at an easier level to work at.  Note the drawings are in their right side \nup position. \n \nInstallation of the aft brake and rudder pedals is next.  Refer to drawing number B92-\nINS-0273 for details.  The rudder pedal and rudder pedal driver must be mounted in the \nvertical position.  The rudder pedal stands upright and the rudder pedal driver hangs \ndown when the fuselage is in its upright position.  When sandwiching the brake pedal \nbetween two rivets, allow the pedal to swing freely but do not allow them to slide from \nside to side. \n \nLocate drawing number B92-INS-0271, swing arm instructions.  Lightly lubricate the \nswing arm guide rails and crank weldment threads with grease.  Install the swing arm \nand check to make sure it can be adjusted through its operating range.  Leave it in a \nposition that is approximately centered before install the rudder pedals. \n \nLocate drawing number B92-INS-0274 (use B01-INS-1242 for S and SS models), \nrudder pedal assembly instructions.  First mount the rudder pedals to the pedal axle and \nthe swing arm.  The pedals and pedal swing arm may need to be reamed to 1/2 inch.  \nNext, install the steering arm push/pull rods and threaded rudder cable tangs.  If the \nsteering arm push/pull rods are installed properly, the steering arm should be in a \nstraight, forward position and the rudder pedals should be vertical.  Finally, install the \nrudder pedal driver push/pull rods.  The rudder pedals and rudder pedal drivers should \nbe vertical if the push/pull rods are installed correctly. \n \nIf you have the Matco hydraulic brake option, locate drawing number B01-INS-1244.  \nInstall the toe brake pedals as depicted.  Use one steel rivet, SD42BS, to attach each \nouter brake pedal retainer sleeve. \n \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nTWO PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nInstall the aft pedals using drawing B92-INS-0273.  The aft rudder pedals may be set \nslightly forward or slightly aft of vertical to accommodate larger or smaller pilots.  This \nwill be done when the rudder cables are installed later in the assembly process. \n \nNext, install the control stick assembly using drawing number B95-INS-0503 (use B01-\nINS-1240 for S and SS models).  The torque tube should ride on the nylon bushings \nonly and not any metal surfaces.  Both control stick mounts should be flush with the \nends of the torque tube.  A very important step that is sometimes missed is the \nsandwiching of the center control guide and the main torque tube bushing between the \ntorque tube retainer sleeve and the aft control stick mount.  The sandwiched parts need \nto be loose enough to allow the torque tube to turn, but tight enough so the torque tube \nwill not move forward or aft.  If the torque tube is allowed to more forward and aft, pitch \ncontrol will be inadequate.  All rivets that penetrate the torque tube need to be placed in \nthe sides as depicted.  If rivets are installed in the top or bottom of the torque tube, the \npush/pull tube will bind.  Lightly grease the bushings prior to final assembly. \n \nSlide the master aileron driver (TC92-150) in place but do not rivet.  If you have an S or \nSS model, install the aileron side shaft weldment and linkage as depicted on drawing \nnumber B01-INS-1256.  Lightly grease the plastic bushings. \n \nThe next two steps are rather simple—installing the nylon main control guide to the \nfuselage frame and installing the rudder cable guides to the crank-bushing bracket \n(welded to the fuselage frame).  Refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0236 and B92-INS-\n0271 for details. \n \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0182.  For bonding purposes, sand the inside \nsurface of the forward and aft sockets.  This is completed while the fuselage is upside \ndown to provide easy access to the sockets.  Do not permanently install the tail boom at \nthis point. \n \nNext, place fuselage in its upright position for the installation of the tail boom, vertical \nand strake assemblies.  Locate drawing numbers B92-INS-0182 and B92-INS-0183 for \ndetails.  Slide the tail boom into place.  It may be temporarily held in place with a large \nhose clamp.  Install the vertical assembly to the tail boom, and then set the vertical \nassembly 90 degrees from level.  A plumb bob or electronic can be used.  During this \nprocess make sure the fuselage remains level.  All lubricants must be removed from the \ntail boom and both sockets before bonding.  Install the strake after the tail boom is \npermanently installed.  Note on drawing number B92-INS-0183 the SS strake dimension \nis different than the other Tornado models. \n \nThe next step is to route the rudder cables through the fuselage.  Drawing number B92-\nINS-0236 will be used for actual cable routing and B92-INS-0191 (use B92-INS-1241 for \nS and SS models) will be used for mounting the rudder cable to the rudder control arm.   \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nTWO PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nAt this point, do not mount the rudder control arm to the rudder or the opposite end of \nthe rudder cables to the rudder pedals.  If you have the Matco hydraulic brake option, \nlook at the hydraulic system brake cable routing depicted on drawing numbers B01-INS-\n1244 and B01-INS-1255.  The brake master cylinders should also be mounted at this \ntime.  Drawing number B01-INS-1159 shows an exploded view of the assembly.  \n \nConstruction of the stabilator is the next step.  You will need drawing numbers B92-INS-\n0184 for the 7’ stabilator or B01-INS-1238 and B01-INS-1313 for the 8’ stabilator.  Even \nthough the stabilator leading edge had been factory assembled, the rivet line that runs \ndown the spar centerline must be installed.  Follow the dimensions so that the rivets will \nclear the spar lightening holes.  After completion of the stabilator, the anti-servo tab \nshould be temporarily installed using drawing numbers B92-INS-0188 for the 7’ \nstabilator or B01-INS-1239 for the 8’ stabilator and B98-INS-0970. \n \nNow install the stabilator mount ring.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-1297.  Once \nagain, ensure the fuselage remains level for this procedure.  Also, double-check the \nstabilator is level and aligned before drilling.  At this time, permanently install the \nstabilator mount ring, but not the stabilator, as it will be removed later to gain access to \nthe tail boom interior. \n \nThe anti-servo control system is installed next.  Drawing numbers B92-INS-0181, B92-\nINS-0226, B92-INS-0227, and B92-INS-0228 will be needed.  Most of the parts that \nmount in the tail boom are factory assembled to the trim torque tube.  Slide the trim \ntorque tube into the rear of the tail boom and out the front through the main control \nguide and into the fuselage.  Position the components in the tail boom as shown in \ndrawing number B92-INS-0181.  Next, mount the trimwheel to the seat frame as \ndetailed in drawing numbers B92-INS-0226, B92-INS-0227, and B92-INS-0228.  Once \neverything is in proper position, it may then be permanently installed.  The trim torque \ntube should run under the rudder control arm. \n \nThe tail wheel should be mounted next.  This is a simple procedure.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0195.   \n \nLocate drawing numbers B92-INS-0236 and B93-INS-0334.  Mount the brake pedals to \nthe rudder pedals, making sure they will clear all obstacles such as the rudder pedals \nand fuselage frame.  When “sandwiching” the brake pedals between two rivets, ensure \nthe pedals swing easily, but do not slide side to side.  Next, route the brake cable \nsheathing as illustrated in drawing number B92-INS-0236.  Insert the brake cable \nthrough the sheathing and mount the cable as described in drawing number B93-INS-\n0334.  Before permanently installing main brake cables, slide the nicos for the aft brake \ncables onto the main brake cables.  Nico the aft brake cables after the main brake \ncables have been installed and adjusted. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nTWO PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nThe rudder cables should be completed using drawing number B92-INS-0236.  First, \ntemporarily install the rudder.  The rudder cables should already be routed through the \ntail boom.  Make sure they did not tangle with the trim torque tube.  Route the cables \nthrough the fuselage, installing the turnbuckles and finally mounting the cables to the \nrudder pedal via the rudder pedal tang.  Note that the rudder pedals and rudder should \nbe in neutral position during the assembly process.  When complete, shine a light into \nthe tail boom and make sure the cables are not wound around each other or around the \ntrim torque tube.  Install safety wire so the turnbuckles will not loosen or become \ndisconnected. \n \nNote:  For 1994 models and earlier \nRoute stabilator control cables next, referring to drawing numbers B92-INS-0236 and \nB92-INS-260.  Route cables through tail boom so that they do not ride on any other \nmetal surfaces (other cables, rudder control arm, etc…).  Next, attach the aft end of the \nstabilator control cables to the stabilator control horn.  Temporarily mount the stabilator \nto the stabilator mount ring, install the turnbuckles, and mount the cables to the elevator \ndriver.  Ensure the cables are set to the neutral position as described in the drawing and \ncheck for full stabilator deflection.  If full deflection is not achieved, adjust cables while \ncontinuing to keep them in the neutral position, until full deflection is reached.  All slack \nmust be adjusted out of the cables. \n \nNote:  For 1995 models and later \nRefer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0236, B95-INS-0516, and B96-INS-0758 (use B05-\nINS-1434 for SS model) to install the forward push/pull tube (TC95-250) in the main \npush/pull tube assembly (TC95-243).  Align the 3/16” drill holes in each tube and then \ndrill the rest of the way through both tubes with a 3/16” drill.  Remove the forward \npush/pull tube, sand, acetone, and epoxy it to ensure the adhesive insulates the \naluminum from the steel.  The rear push/pull tube weldment is installed with this same \nmethod.  The support plug (TC95-233) is used to restrict the amount of deflection, while \nthe system is in compression or down stick.  The support plug will also help guide the \nmain push/pull assembly for clearance around the rudder bushing.  Install the support \nplug so that it is positioned as depicted on drawing number B95-INS-0516.  This view is \nfrom the rear of the aircraft.   \n \nNext, route the main elevator push/pull tube assembly through the tail boom so that it \ngoes through the support plug’s 1 1/4\" hole and under the landing gear truss but over \nthe main control guide (TC95-259) that is shown on drawing number B92-INS-0236.  \nTemporarily mount the rear push/pull weldment to the stabilator control horn and the \nforward push/pull tube weldment to the elevator driver.  Ensure that stabilator is level to \nthe left rear longeron tube.  Set control to the neutral position, then check for full \ndeflection as described on drawing number B96-INS-0758 (use B05-INS-1434 for SS \nmodel).  If full deflection is not achieved, adjust until it is reached. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

Refer \nto drawing numbers B92-INS-0187 and B98-INS-0970.  The push/pull rod should run \ninline with the tail boom.  Position the anti-servo control horn accordingly.  The forward \nmost rivet hole of the control horn receives a larger rivet than the other three.  Cut slots \nin the stabilator aft skin so the push/pull rod can pass through. \n \nThe flap detent strip may be installed at this time.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-\n0237.  This is a very simple procedure.  This step is not necessary with the electric flap \noption. \n \nIf equipped with a 10-gallon fuel tank, refer to drawing number B92-INS-0252 for \ninstallation.  The fuel tank should not extend beyond the indicated fuselage tube, as it \nwould interfere with the rear seat or back panel.  Refer to drawing number B96-INS-\n0786 for fuel line routing. \n \nIf equipped with a 15-gallon fuel tank, refer to drawing number B03-INS-1391 for \ninstallation.  Refer to drawing numbers B02-INS-1379, B02-INS-1380, and B97-INS-\n0842 for fuel system connection to the tank. \n \nInstallation of the instrument panel and hood is next.  Refer to drawing number B92-\nINS-0266 for installation instructions.  When laying out the instruments onto the \ninstrument panel, use extra care to prevent the instruments from colliding with any of \nthe fuselage tubes.  The instrument panel may be as tall as needed, but ensure the \npilot’s legs will comfortably fit under the panel.  Do not permanently install the \ninstrument panel at this time; access to the rear of the panel is need for wiring \npurposes. \n \nFor wiring, temporarily mount the engine to the fuselage referencing drawing number \nB92-INS-0266.  The exhaust does not need to be installed at this time.  Using drawing \nnumbers B92-INS-0231 and B92-INS-0233, install the throttle handle and throttle cable.  \nNote, the throttle cable is sheathed from the cable stop to the engine.  Also, note that \nthe engine will have to be removed later for painting purposes.  The drawing numbers \nlisted above are for the two stroke engines.  The 912 engine installation and wiring \ndiagrams are also included in the back of the manual.  Use only the appropriate \ndrawings for your engine.  Note that other engines may use a different throttle handle \nand choke system. \n \nEven though there are wiring diagrams included in the manual, due to the wide variety \nof instrumentation, lighting, and avionics options, it is recommended that these items be \nwired using reference materials supplied by their manufacturer. \n \n \n \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nTWO PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nDrawing number B92-DT-0251 is a diagram of the mag switches pinout and switch \ncondition of each key position.  All of the wiring diagrams and information contained on \nthe diagrams may not apply to each aircraft, as it depends on which options have been \nordered.  Install the electrical connectors provided in the kit, near the engine and \noutside the aircraft.  This makes engine removal much easier.  Studs have been welded \ninto the fuselage for grounding purposes. \n \nThe belly skins may now be permanently installed.  Once again, use drawing numbers \nB92-INS-0254 (use B05-INS-1435 for SS model), and B92-INS-0255.  Only the pre-\ndrilled mounting holes should be riveted.  The forward skin should overlap the aft skin. \n \nNext, install the nose cone and pitot tube, refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0269 and \nB97-INS-0936.  When cutting out the slot on the bottom of the nose cone, ensure that it \nis along the inner edge of the fuselage tubes.  To protect the pitot tube from inadvertent \ndamage, do not allow it to extend beyond the front edge of the nose cone.  The nose \ncone may be permanently installed at this time.  The nose cone should overlap the \nforward belly skin. \n \nInstallation of the left window is the next step.  Use drawing number B92-INS-0313 for \nthis procedure.  The notes on the drawing are the steps for installing the window.  \nPlease read and follow them carefully.  The better the window is clamped to the \nfuselage, the closer to actual shape it will be.  This will make the assembly process \nmuch easier.  Do not drill near the wing fittings.  This may degrade the structural \nintegrity of the aircraft and eventually cause failure.  The Lexan strip that runs down the \nforward down tube serves as a spacer for the front door.  Aircraft with .090” windows will \nhave a .060” strip provided.  Do not permanently install the window at this time. \n \nNext, install the upper right window and moldings.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-\n0314 for details.  This window and molding installation should be much easier than the \nleft window.  Once again, take time to install them correctly and follow the steps in the \ndrawing.  Do no permanently mount the windows at this time. \n \nLocate drawing number B92-INS-0316 for the installation of the front door.  Follow the \nsteps outlined in the drawing.  For the best appearance, ensure the door skin is aligned \nwith the belly skin on the opposite side of the aircraft.  The 3/8” to 1/2\" gap between the \ndoorframe and fuselage frame is to prevent the door from catching on the fuselage \nduring use.  Removing the left window at the time of the door window installation allows \nclamping of the door window to the fuselage down tube.  The hinge should overlap the \ndoor window.  Do not permanently install the door skin or window at this time. \n \nThe rear door should be installed next using drawing number B92-INS-0318.  As with \nthe front door, there must be a 1/4\" gap between the two frames.  Again, follow the \nsteps in the drawing.  Also, notice the hinge mounting detail in the lower left corner of \nthe drawing.  Do not permanently install the door at this time. \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nTWO PLACE ASSEMBLY PROCEDURES \n(Continued) \n \nNext, prepare the aircraft for painting.  First remove the windows, doors, stabilator, \nrudder and engine.  At this time apply the stits material to the rudder, stabilator, and the \naft portion of the fuselage, if applicable.  Use drawing number B92-INS-0312 for the \nlayout of the covering fabric.  Refer to stits manual provided for the covering procedure.  \nAfter the fabric has been installed, these items may be painted.  Do not get any \nacetone, paint or paint thinner on any plastic, foam, or other synthetic parts as it will \ndestroy those materials. \n \nAfter the aircraft has been painted, the rudder, stabilator, engine, windows and doors \nmay be permanently installed.  Refer back to the appropriate drawings for details.  The \nwindows may be sealed with silicone to prevent any water leakage.  Also, upon final  \nassembly of the windows, the wing gap seal must be installed.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0320 for details.   \n \nAfter the doors have been permanently installed, the door latches may then be installed.  \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0241 for the front door latch and drawing number \nB92-INS-0243 for the rear door latch.  The heads of the rivets that mount on the \nfuselage exterior (for the rear door latch) may be painted before installation or touched \nup after installation. \n \nIf applicable, install the pulley and guides for the pull start rope.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0243 for details.  Be sure not to mount the nylon bushing where they \nwill interfere with the wing. \n \nThe wing may now be mounted to the fuselage.  If the wing has not been assembled, \nplease turn to that section of the manual.  See drawing number B92-INS-0321 for wing \nmounting details.  It is normal to have some play between the two pairs of forward wing \nfittings.  Do not over tighten the nuts and bolts causing the wing fittings to bend.  Refer \nto drawing number B92-INS-0321 to mount the rear wing fittings to the wing.  Now that \nthe wing has been mounted, the leading edge gap seal can be installed. \nAilerons and control stick must be kept in a neutral position for the next procedures.  \nYou can lock your ailerons in position with the aileron center stand on drawing number \nB96-INS-0759.  First, pre-drill one end of the main aileron push/pull tube.  Then, \nmeasure in 1/2\" from the end of the main aileron push/pull tube, drill a 5/16” hole \nthrough one side of the tube and insert one aileron push/pull tube end (TC91-4) to act \nas a guide and drill through the other side.  Bolt the aileron push/pull tube end to the \nmain aileron push/pull tube.  Then thread a 1/4\" ball joint with a jam nut halfway into the \naileron push/pull tube end.  Attach the main aileron push/pull tube to the center aileron \ndrivers with the aileron torque tube stand to lock the ailerons in the neutral position.  \nInsert the other aileron torque tube end into the other end of the main aileron push/pull \ntube; do not drill at this end.  Attach the main aileron push/pull tube to the master aileron \ndriver (TC92-150).  Slide the master aileron driver forward until you have 1 1/2\" of \nclearance between the main aileron push/pull tube and the front seat support tube.   \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

It \nwill also determine the distance from the center control guide and the bushing to the \ncenter of the master aileron driver or dimension “A” on drawing number B95-INS-0503.  \nNow, set the height of the master aileron driver.  This is measured from the fuselage \nfloor tubes to the center of the threaded end of the master aileron driver’s bolt or \ndimension “B” on drawing number B95-INS-0503.  Dimension “B” is determined by \nachieving a 90 degree angle between the master aileron driver and the main aileron \npush/pull tube. \n \nIf you have an S or SS model, refer to drawing numbers B02-INS-1376 and B02-INS-\n1377 to install the main aileron push/pull tube (TC04-396).  Make sure the ailerons are \nlocked in the neutral position and the control stick is in the neutral position before \ninstalling and adjusting the main aileron push/pull tube.  The ailerons may be locked \nusing the aileron center stand depicted on drawing number B01-INS-1247.  Remember \nto remove the aileron center stand when finished.",

The following are some general \nnotes and guidelines regarding aircraft assembly. \n \nThe first step in the assembly process is to sit down and read through the entire \ninstruction packet.  This is necessary for two reasons.  First is to familiarize yourself with \nthe aircraft and its assemblies and second, to get comfortable with our somewhat \nunique style of instructions and to be able to find information form their pages as \nneeded. \n \nA brief description of out part number system is also needed.  Here is a sample number: \n \nTG92-16 \n \n“T” designates Tornado parts \n \n“G” represents the location on the aircraft: \n \nC = Control System \nE = Instrumentation & Wiring \nF = Fuselage \nG = Landing Gear \nH = Hardware \nP = Engine and Prop \nT = Tail \nW = Wing \n \n“92” is the year in which the number was assigned \n \n“16” is the part number \n \nWhen the construction process has begun, we recommend that every assembly be test \nfitted with clecos before final assembly.  Most instruction pates do no mention this, but it \nmust be done to ensure proper fit and alignment of the parts. \n \nWe recommend that a #30 split point drill bit be used for drilling rivet holes.  A split point \ndrill will not wander when you begin drilling.  We also recommend the purchase of a \nlong #30 split point drill.  This will aid in such areas as wing and stabilator construction. \n \n \n \nAll parts, especially drilled holes, must be deburred to prevent stress risers and crack \npropagation, which could cause part failure.  To remove burrs from sheet metal, use a \ndeburring tool or sandpaper, and for drilled holes use a deburring tool or 1/2\" drill bit. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nINTRODUCTION \n(Continued) \n \nAll parts that are bonded together with epoxy or Uralane 8089 must have their mating \nsurfaces sanded and degreased.  Sanding parts provides a somewhat rough surface for \nthe epoxy or Uralane to grab.  Sanding also removes the oxidation layer from aluminum \nparts that provides a stronger bond.  For this reason, aluminum parts can be degreased \nwith either acetone or lacquer thinner.  Do not allow acetone, lacquer thinner or other \nsolvents to come in contact with any Lexan, wing D-Cell or other plastic and foam parts, \nas solvents will destroy most synthetic materials. \n \nTo provide corrosion resistance, all parts maybe painted.  For steel, use any rust \npreventative paint.  Aluminum parts should be painted with a two-part epoxy or zinc \ncromate system. \n \nAll moving parts must be lubricated.  This includes cables where they ride through their \nguides, nico thimbles and shackles.  This will provide much smoother operation and \nslow the wearing process of parts. \n \nOnce again, please read and understand the instruction packet before beginning to \nbuild the aircraft.  If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact us. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nWING ASSEMBLY 20’ \n \n \nA VERY IMPORTANT NOTE found on many wing drawings states “Do not drill any \nunspecified holes into spar”.   This is extremely important as any extra holes may, under \nextreme conditions, WEAKEN THE SPAR.  Note; refer to drawing number B96-INS-\n0780 for further details on drilling the spar. \n \nFirst, place the wing D-cell in the foam stands provided with the kit.  This will provide a \nstable support for wing construction. The perspective of most side views is from the \nbottom side of the wing (mounted to the fuselage).  All top views are looking down onto \nthe wing with the wing bottom (when mounted to the fuselage) toward the bottom of the \npage.   As a result, to keep the drawing in perspective, build the wing from the bottom \nside.  The quickest way to determine this is by examining the position of the wing \nfittings, as the wing fittings will stick out the bottom of the wing. \n \nThe first parts mounted to the wing D-cell are the 7-inch hat sections.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B93-INS-0335 for details.  On the side view of the drawing these parts \nresemble an upside down “V”.  The hat sections are dimensioned to their centerlines.  \nThe hat sections may be permanently installed at this time.  Two different types of rivets \nare used to mount the hat sections. \n \nAlso found on drawing number B93-INS-0335 is the rib layout.  There are four different \nribs that get mounted to the D-cell.  There should be 14 long ribs with 2 lightening holes, \n2 shorter ribs and 2 different long ribs with 1 lightening hole.  The 14 ribs are mounted \nto the wing with the flat side toward the right and the flanged side toward the left.  These \nribs are dimensioned to their centers.  The flat side and flanges of the shorter ribs are \npositioned the same as the longer ribs.  One of the shorter ribs mounts at the D-cell \ncenter and the other mounts flush with the left wing fitting.  The final two long ribs mount \n15 inches from the D-cell center.  These two ribs are dimensioned to their inside edge \nand are positioned so their flat surface is toward the center of the wing.  The two ribs \nform the wing box section.  There is a right and left rib.  If they are mounted on the \ncorrect side, their trailing edge should match the other long ribs.  Do not permanently \ninstall the ribs at this time.  Use clecos to hold everything in place and check for square \nand proper fit. \n \nAt this point the flap and aileron torque tubes should be inserted into the wing, including \nthe nylon bushings for the flap torque tube.  Refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0326 \nand B92-INS-0337.  Do not permanently install the torque tubes at this time. \n \nThe rear spar should be mounted next.  Refer to drawing number B93-INS-0338 for this \nprocedure.  It is very important that the ribs remain perpendicular to the D-cell spar \nduring this process.  The rear spar comes in two 96-inch sections and must be trimmed \nto fit.  Next, install the intermediate spar, keeping everything square.  Now install the hat \nsections to both sides of the wing.  They come in 48-inch lengths and must be \ncombined and trimmed to fit.   Once again, keep everything square.  Finally, install the \nflap and aileron hinge doublers under the rear spar.  Please note which surfaces of the  \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O. Box 190 • Austinburg, Ohio 44010-0130 • USA \nPhone: (440) 275-3205 • Fax: (440) 275-3192 • www.titanaircraft.com \nWING ASSEMBLY 20’ \n(Continued) \n \nhat sections and spars are riveted.  Any surface that comes in contact with the wing skin \nshould not be riveted, as the wing skin will not lay flat when installed.  At this time only \nrivet the rear spar, intermediate spar and hat sections.  The ribs should still be clecoed. \n \nReferring to drawing number B92-INS-0340, check the wings washout.  If the washout \nis not at the angle and tolerances specified, shim the ribs until they are reached.  After \nthe washout is set, the ribs may be riveted into place.  The ribs are riveted with two \ntypes of rivets.  \n \nInstall the intermediate spar webs.  Drawing number B92-INS-0199 describes this \nprocess.  Ensure the 1 5/8 hole is drilled in the proper location.  The intermediate spar \nwebs may be permanently installed. \n \nRefer back to drawing number B92-INS-0337 for installation of the aileron control \nsystem.  Please ensure each aileron driver is installed in its proper position.  Stands \nmay be constructed to aid in this.  Also make sure the torque tubes form a straight line \nwith each other, as illustrated in the drawing.  The aileron controls may be permanently \ninstalled at this time. \n \nPermanently install the flap control system next.  Drawing number B92-INS-0326 \nexplains the procedures.  Take time to ensure the flap drivers are installed correctly.  \nNote which direction they point in relation to the top and bottom of the wing.  Ensure \nthat all moving parts ride on the nylon bushings and not any metal surfaces. \n \nRefer back to drawing number B93-INS-0338 and install the flap mount hat section.  Do \nnot rivet to any surfaces that come in contact with the skin. \n \nCheck the washout.  If it is still set, the skinning process can begin.  If not, adjust the \nwing until the proper washout is set.  Refer to drawing number B93-INS-0341 for the \nwing skin installation.  Take time to ensure each skin is laying flat and is tight against \nthe wing structure.  This will help prevent any “oil canning” effect with the skins.  The \nwashout must be checked frequently during the skinning process.  Once the skins are \ninstalled, the washout cannot be adjusted.  After all the skins have been fitted, remove \nand prep them for bonding.  If needed, run wiring for navigation and strobe lights \nthrough the wing.  The channel formed by the hat section on the top surface of the wing \nis the best for running wing tip wiring.  Skins may be permanently installed with rivets \nand Uralane 8089 at this time.  The inspection holes may now be drilled into the wing \nskin.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0154 for their locations.  The inspection holes \nallow for access to the control systems.  The holes are only drilled thru the bottom wing \nskin.  Inspection hole covers are provided. \nMount hinges and counterweight to the ailerons referring to drawing number B92-INS-\n0258.  Mount hinges to the flaps using drawing number B92-INS-0259.  When mounting \nthe hinges, ensure they are flush with the surface of the ailerons or flaps as illustrated in \nthe upper right corner of both drawings. \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

Install push/pull rod so both \naileron and aileron drivers are in the neutral position. \n \nReferring to drawing number B92-INS-0263, mount flaps to the wing, making sure the \nbolt on the aileron control horn will clear the flaps as the aileron is operated.  With flap \npush/pull rods installed, the flaps and flap drivers should be in the neutral position. \n \nOnce the ailerons and flaps have been installed, the flap handle may be mounted.  \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0242 for details.  When first examined, this appears \nto be fairly complicated setup.  Therefore, a sketch of completed flap handle system is \nlocated in the bottom left hand corner of the page. \n \nReferring to drawing number B92-INS-0264, install the wingtip ribs.  After the wingtip \nribs have been installed, mount the wingtips to the wing.  The wingtips will have to be \ntrimmed to allow the aileron and counterweight to move.  The wingtips may be painted.  \nDo not allow acetone, paint, paint thinner or lacquer thinner to come in contact with the \nwing’s D-cell.  The D-cell contains a foam core and would be damaged by those \nmaterials. Note; navigational and strobe lights must be installed before permanently \ninstalling the wingtips. \n \nThe wing is now ready to be mounted to the fuselage.",

The quickest way to determine this is by examining the position of the wing \nfittings, as the wing fittings will stick out the bottom of the wing. \n \nLocate drawing number B92-INS-0324 for the rib and hat section layout.  Ribs are \ndimensioned on the top and the hat sections are dimensioned on the bottom side.  All \ndimensions are taken from the center of the D-cell.  You will need a fine point felt tip \nmarker and 12’ tape measure for the next steps. \n \nMark the rib and hat section locations, then with a machinist square or combination \nsquare, draw a line across the D-cell spar web at each rib and hat location.  This will \nkeep the bases of the ribs perpendicular to the D-cell. \n \nRefer to drawing number B96-INS-0779 for the aft wing preparation (TW92-11).  The \n.016” ribs may require some additional trimming where the flanges intersect.  Be sure to \nonly remove enough material to relieve any interference between the two flanges.  Next \nyou will want to mark the rib centerlines and rivet locations, using the wing skin pattern \non drawing number B92-INS-0328.  Referring to drawing number B96-INS-0784, you \ncan make the wing skin rivet pattern templates (TW96-100 & TW96-101) out of 2” strips \nof .016” aluminum (they can also be supplied as an additional option).  These templates \ncan be used to mark rivet locations on the ribs, which you will need to know for the \nfluting procedure to follow.  Note that the angles in the rivet pattern templates \ncorrespond to the angles on the trailing edge of the ribs. \n \nAdditionally, there is another method that can be used for locating the rib centerlines \nand rivet locations.  This will require a piece of wafer board or plywood 1/4\" thick.  You \ncan lay one of the .016” ribs with its flat surface down and take 2” strips of 1/4\" material \nand outline the rib.  Then you will need to mark the rivet locations on the board to form \nthe outer perimeter.  Note that the rivet pattern is different between the top and bottom \nside of the rib.  The rivet pattern is dimensioned from the trailing edge of the ribs.  While \nholding the aft wing flat in the jig, mark the rib centerlines and rivet locations. \n \n \n \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

Next is fluting.  It may be necessary to \nflute the ribs with fluting pliers to remove any bowing in the ribs caused in the forming \nprocess.  Do not flute the ribs where any of the rivet locations are.  Flute the rib flanges \nso that the groove is toward the inside.  As you squeeze the pliers lightly, you should be \nable to see the bow in the ribs start to straighten.  Do not try to remove all of the bow \nwith just one flute, bring it inline over a number of flutes.  After fluting, recheck the \ncenterlines. \n \nNext, you will want to pre-drill the hat sections and ribs, using the pattern on drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0324.  Only drill the base of the ribs at this time.  It is important that \nyou drill the base on its centerline, as you will use this drill pattern to sight through or \nmark the alignment on the D-cell.  *Caution* the two outside holes must be kept inline \nwith the existing rivets in the spar caps, see drawing number B96-INS-0780.  Not \nmaintaining these hole locations can result in a catastrophic wing failure. \n \nThe first parts mounted to the wing D-cell are the 7-inch hat sections.  Refer to drawing \nnumber B92-INS-0324 for details.  On the side view of the drawing these parts \nresemble an upside down “V”.  The hat sections are dimensioned to their centerlines.  \nThe hat sections may be permanently installed at this time.  Two different types of rivets \nare used to mount the hat sections. \n \nAlso found on drawing number B92-INS-0324 is the rib layout.  There are four different \nribs that get mounted to the D-cell.  There should be 18 long ribs with 2 lightening holes, \n2 shorter ribs and 2 different long ribs with 1 lightening hole.  The 18 ribs are mounted \nto the wing with the flat side toward the right and the flanged side toward the left.  These \nribs are dimensioned to their centers.  The flat side and flanges of the shorter ribs are \npositioned the same as the longer ribs.  One of the shorter ribs mounts at the D-cell \ncenter and the other mounts flush with the left wing fitting.  The final two long ribs mount \n15 inches from the D-cell center.  These two ribs are dimensioned to their inside edge \nand are positioned so their flat surface is toward the center of the wing.  The two ribs \nform the wing box section.  There is a right and left rib.  If they are mounted on the \ncorrect side, their trailing edge should match the other long ribs.  Do not permanently \ninstall the ribs at this time.  Use clecos to hold everything in place and check for square \nand proper fit. \n \nAt this point the flap torque tube (TC92-98) should be inserted into the wing with flap \nbushings (TC92-99) and flap driver weldments (TC92-97).  It may be necessary to \ntemporarily remove three of the .016” ribs.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0326.  If \nyou have the electric flap option, refer to drawing numbers B95-INS-0593 and B95-INS-\n0595.  At this point the aileron torque tubes should be inserted into the wing.  Refer to \ndrawing number B92-INS-0325.  Do not permanently install the torque tubes at this \ntime. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

Refer to drawing number \nB92-INS-0327.  Position the intermediate spar between the .025” ribs so that the top of \nthe intermediate spar is 15” from the D-cell and flush with the .025” ribs.  One method \nused to insure that you get everything square is to make two strips from 1/8” aluminum, \n42” long and 1/2\" wide.  With a #30 drill bit, drill a hole 1” in and on center on one end of \neach strip.  Next, you will need to strap duplicate one of the pre-drilled holes in the spar \ncap on the top side near the base of each .025” rib.  Cleco the strips at the spar cap and \nclamp at the opposite .025” near its trailing edge, so the two strips for an “X” across the \nwing box area.  Add clamps as needed to hold the wing box secure.  Additional support \ncan be achieved by clamping a straight edge on the opposite side across the .025” ribs.  \nAfter square and proper fit have been checked, refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0232 \nand B92-INS-0327 for the intermediate spar to rib rivet hole locations.  The intermediate \nspar flange to rib rivet line is as follows:  outer two holes must be a minimum of 1/2\" in \nfrom the .025” rib flanges and intermediate spar to center section rib rivet line and a \nminimum of 1/2\" in from the edge of the rear spar flange.  Do not permanently install the \nintermediate spar at this time. \n \nThe rear spar should be mounted next.  Refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-0327 and \nB96-INS-0749 for this procedure.  It is very important that the ribs remain perpendicular \nto the D-cell spar during this process.  The rear spar comes in two 96” sections and two \n24” sections.  One method used to insure everything is square is to take on 96” aft spar \nand place it along the base of the ribs so that one of the spar flanges can be slid \nbetween the D-cell skin and the spar caps.  The inboard side of the aft spar is inset be \n1/16” to the flat side of the .025” rib.  Transfer the centerline marks from the ribs on top \nto the aft spar using a combination square.  Place the aft spar in position on the aft wing \nribs.  Align the aft with the centerline marks on the ribs and spar.  Clamp each rib in \nplace as you get them aligned.  Next is the 24” aft spar, refer to drawing numbers B96-\nINS-0635 and B96-INS-0749. \n \nThe 24” and 96” spar sections combined should have a total length of 114\".  There are \ntwo methods available:  the butt-splice method is more cosmetic while the over lap \nmethod is designed for simplicity.  Either method is equally functional. \n \nNow install the hat section to both sides of the wing.  They also come in 96” and 24” \nsections.  Use the same method to mark the rib centerline locations on the aft spar.  \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0327.  The 96” hat section will be installed so that it \nsets in the “V”s of the .016” aft wing ribs and is beneath the .025” rib flange.  Combine \nthe hat sections for a total span of 114\".  Clamp the hat sections in place.  It is important \nthat the ribs remain perpendicular to the D-cell spar, as it will be necessary to locate the \nribs for installing the wing skins.  Check to make sure the wing is square.  Now drill and \ncleco the hat section and aft spar to the rib.  Any surface that comes in contact with the \nwing skin should not be riveted, as the skin will not lay flat when installed. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

Drill through the center of the flange \non the “V”s of the .016” ribs into the hat sections.  Refer to drawing numbers B92-INS-\n0327 and B96-INS-0749 for the aft spar rivet patterns.  Drill and cleco in place.  Before \ndrilling the aft spar, mark the ribs that will have a hinge doubler, do no drill the four rivets \nin these ribs, as the hinges will be installed later.  Hinge doublers can now be installed \nbeneath the aft spar and on top of the ribs.  Outboard aileron hinge doublers are to be \nflush with the end of the wing.  The inboard flap hinge doublers are to be flush to the rib.  \nTo make the hinge doubler rivet line, drill 1 1/4\" in form the spar line at five evenly \nspaced locations with one being through the rib.  The hinge doublers should be bonded \nto the aft spar to aid in the skinning process.  At this time only rivet the aft spar, \nintermediate spar, and hat sections.  The ribs should still be clecoed to the D-cell. \n \nReferring to drawing number B92-INS-0329, check the wings washout.  If the washout \nis not at the angle and tolerances specified, shim the ribs until they are reached.  After \nthe washout is set, the ribs may be riveted into place.  The ribs are riveted with two \ntypes of rivets.  \n \nInstall the intermediate spar webs.  Drawing number B92-INS-0232 describes this \nprocess.  Ensure the 1 5/8” hole is drilled in the proper location.  The intermediate spar \nwebs may be permanently installed. \n \nRefer back to drawing number B92-INS-0325 for installation of the aileron control \nsystem.  Please ensure each aileron driver is installed in its proper position.  Stands \nmay be constructed to aid in this.  Also make sure the torque tubes form a straight line \nwith each other, as illustrated in the drawing.  The aileron controls may be permanently \ninstalled at this time. \n \nPermanently install the flap control system next.  Drawing number B92-INS-0326 \nexplains the procedures.  Take time to ensure the flap drivers are installed correctly.  \nNote which direction they point in relation to the top and bottom of the wing.  Ensure \nthat all moving parts ride on the nylon bushings and not any metal surfaces.  Refer to \ndrawing numbers B95-INS-0593, B95-INS-0595, and B96-INS-0732. \n \nRefer back to drawing number B92-INS-0327 and install the flap mount hat section.  Do \nnot rivet to any surfaces that come in contact with the skin.  Do not install the flap mount \nhat section when using the electric flap system. \n \nCheck the washout.  If it is still set, the skinning process can begin.  If not, adjust the \nwing until the proper washout is set.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0328 for the \nwing skin installation.  Take time to ensure each skin is laying flat and is tight against \nthe wing structure.  This will help prevent any “oil canning” effect with the skins.  The \nwashout must be checked frequently during the skinning process.  Once the skins are \ninstalled, the washout cannot be adjusted. \n \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

If needed, run \nwiring for navigation and strobe lights through the wing.  The channel formed by the hat \nsection on the top surface of the wing is the best for running wing tip wiring.  Skins may \nbe permanently installed with rivets and Uralane 5776 A & B at this time.  The \ninspection holes may now be drilled into the bottom wing skin to allow access to the \ncontrol systems.  Refer to drawing number B92-INS-0218 for their locations.  Inspection \nhole covers are provided.  We recommend using lexan.  The 5” diameter hole is moved \nover 1” for the electric flap, the new dimension is 9 1/2\". \n \nMount hinges and counterweight to the ailerons referring to drawing number B92-INS-\n0258.  Mount hinges to the flaps using drawing number B92-INS-0261.  When mounting \nthe hinges, ensure they are flush with the surface of the ailerons or flaps as illustrated in \nthe upper right corner of both drawings. \n \nMount the aileron on the wing such that the counterweight is 1/8 of an inch from the \nwing tip as shown in drawing number B92-INS-0262.  Install push/pull rod so both \naileron and aileron drivers are in the neutral position. \n \nReferring to drawing number B92-INS-0263, mount flaps to the wing, making sure the \nbolt on the aileron control horn will clear the flaps as the aileron is operated.  With flap \npush/pull rods installed, the flaps and flap drivers should be in the neutral position. \n \nOnce the ailerons and flaps have been installed, the flap handle may be mounted.  \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0242 for details.  When first examined, this appears \nto be fairly complicated setup.  Therefore, a sketch of completed flap handle system is \nlocated in the bottom left hand corner of the page.  Do not install with the electric flap \nsystem. \n \nReferring to drawing numbers B92-INS-0264 and B92-INS-0265, install the wingtip ribs.  \nAfter the wingtip ribs have been installed, mount the wingtips to the wing.  The wingtips \nwill have to be trimmed to allow the aileron and counterweight to move.  The wingtips \nmay be painted.  Do not allow acetone, paint, paint thinner or lacquer thinner to come in \ncontact with the wing’s D-cell.  The D-cell contains a foam core and would be damaged \nby those materials. Note; navigational and strobe lights must be installed before \npermanently installing the wingtips. \n \nThe wing is now ready to be mounted to the fuselage.",

This is extremely important as any extra holes may, under \nextreme conditions, WEAKEN THE SPAR.  Note; refer to drawing number B96-INS-\n0780 for further details on drilling the spar. \n \nFirst, place the wing D-cell in the foam stands provided with the kit.  This will provide a \nstable support for wing construction. The perspective of most side views is from the \nbottom side of the wing (mounted to the fuselage).  All top views are looking down onto \nthe wing with the wing bottom (when mounted to the fuselage) toward the bottom of the \npage.   As a result, to keep the drawing in perspective, build the wing from the bottom \nside.  The quickest way to determine this is by examining the position of the wing \nfittings, as the wing fittings will stick out the bottom of the wing. \n \nLocate drawing number B96-INS-0705 for the rib and hat section layout.  Ribs are \ndimensioned on the top and the hat sections are dimensioned on the bottom side.  All \ndimensions are taken from the center of the D-cell.  You will need a fine point felt tip \nmarker and 12’ tape measure for the next steps. \n \nMark the rib and hat section locations, then with a machinist square or combination \nsquare, draw a line across the D-cell spar web at each rib and hat location.  This will \nkeep the bases of the ribs perpendicular to the D-cell. \n \nRefer to drawing number B96-INS-0779 for the aft wing preparation (TW92-11).  The \n.016” ribs may require some additional trimming where the flanges intersect.  Be sure to \nonly remove enough material to relieve any interference between the two flanges.  Next \nyou will want to mark the rib centerlines and rivet locations, using the wing skin pattern \non drawing number B95-INS-0603.  Referring to drawing number B96-INS-0784, you \ncan make the wing skin rivet pattern templates (TW96-100 & TW96-101) out of 2” strips \nof .016” aluminum (they can also be supplied as an additional option).

Take time to ensure each skin is laying flat and is tight against \nthe wing structure.  This will help prevent any “oil canning” effect with the skins.  The \nwashout must be checked frequently during the skinning process.  Once the skins are \ninstalled, the washout cannot be adjusted. \n \n1419 State Route 45 South • P.O.

If needed, run \nwiring for navigation and strobe lights through the wing.  The channel formed by the hat \nsection on the top surface of the wing is the best for running wing tip wiring.  Skins may \nbe permanently installed with rivets and Uralane 5776 A & B at this time.  The \ninspection holes may now be drilled into the bottom wing skin to allow access to the \ncontrol systems.  Inspection hole covers are provided.  We recommend using lexan.  \nThe 5” diameter hole is moved over 1” for the electric flap, the new dimension is 9 1/2\". \n \nMount hinges and counterweight to the ailerons referring to drawing number B96-INS-\n0729.  Mount hinges to the flaps using drawing number B96-INS-0710.  When mounting \nthe hinges, ensure they are flush with the surface of the ailerons or flaps as illustrated in \nthe upper right corner of both drawings. \n \nMount the aileron on the wing such that the counterweight is 1/8 of an inch from the \nwing tip as shown in drawing number B92-INS-0262.  Install push/pull rod so both \naileron and aileron drivers are in the neutral position. \n \nReferring to drawing number B92-INS-0263, mount flaps to the wing, making sure the \nbolt on the aileron control horn will clear the flaps as the aileron is operated.  With flap \npush/pull rods installed, the flaps and flap drivers should be in the neutral position. \n \nOnce the ailerons and flaps have been installed, the flap handle may be mounted.  \nRefer to drawing number B92-INS-0242 for details.  When first examined, this appears \nto be fairly complicated setup.  Therefore, a sketch of completed flap handle system is \nlocated in the bottom left hand corner of the page.  Do not install with the electric flap \nsystem. \n \nFor adjustment of the flight surfaces see drawing number B97-INS-0904. \n \nReferring to drawing numbers B92-INS-0264 and B92-INS-0265, install the wingtip ribs.  \nAfter the wingtip ribs have been installed, mount the wingtips to the wing.  The wingtips \nwill have to be trimmed to allow the aileron and counterweight to move.  The wingtips \nmay be painted.  Do not allow acetone, paint, paint thinner or lacquer thinner to come in \ncontact with the wing’s D-cell.  The D-cell contains a foam core and would be damaged \nby those materials. Note; navigational and strobe lights must be installed before \npermanently installing the wingtips. \n \nThe wing is now ready to be mounted to the fuselage.",
